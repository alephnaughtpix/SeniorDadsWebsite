<H4 align=center>You're the

The only reason you could be possibly reading this is because
you read the email that was published in <STRONG>Maggie 20</STRONG>
verbatim by <STRONG>Chris "Warts 'n' All" Holland</STRONG>... Erm, 
something about a Senior Dads enquiry to Leon, and a test page at this
URL! Well, OK, since you're reading this, if you have an enquiry about
Senior Dads, then why not go <a href="default.html">here</A> to the
<a href="default.html">Senior Dads Homepage</A>, and find out about this
brilliant Atari demo crew?
