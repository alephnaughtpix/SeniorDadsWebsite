<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Maggie's Review of &quot;Anal Tuck&quot;!</FONT></H2>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Fried Bits 96K Intros...</H2>

<P>A swift look at the 96K category which produced some nice stuff, one
or two not so nice things (hello Leon!) <I>[That's
right- &quot;Tautology&quot; wasn't really very good, was it?]</FONT></I>
and one stunner which is something else altogether.. </P>

<P>Worst things first.. <I>[Haha, you really know
how to pile on the ironey Chris!]</FONT></I> </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Anal Tuck Demo (by the *Senior Dads!*)</FONT></B>
<P>
A first look at this demo made me think, &quot;What a pile of crap!&quot;
A second look also made me think &quot;What a pile of crap!&quot; However
a third and deeper look made me think twice about the simplicity and elegance
of this screen, the wobbly and patently fake 'fire effect' which only takes
a single scanline, the single channel 'beep' simulation of 'God save the
Queen' which left the vastly powerful Falcon 16-Bit Codec untouched.. <I>[You
wally, Chris! That was a <B>module</B> playing!! You can download it from
<a href="../../music/default.html#fanfare">here</A> if you don't believe
us!!!]</FONT></I> Indeed, so much of the Falcons system resources were
left ready to use whilst this demo was in progress, that my Falcon was
able to run away to an unnamed South American country to claim political
asylum and post traumatic stress disorder.. </P>

<P>Now, no amount of persuasion will get the bugger to come back home..
</P>

<P><B>Score:- 25% - Why didn't it win!! </B></P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>Probably because everyone was so stunned by our demo that they forgot
to vote for us! </P>
