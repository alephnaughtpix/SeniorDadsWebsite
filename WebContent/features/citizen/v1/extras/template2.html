      How come I've not seen a peep from you readers about my request last week 
      for your views on the best Senior Citizen stories of this past (half) year?!?!? 
      You can mail me you know!!!! You can also send messages to the mailing list 
      as well, and have a right old discussion.... 
      <p> Come on readers, next week's issue is the Xmas one!!!! And after that 
        is the review of the year, so let's have some views by then!!!! Or else, 
        I'll have to do it all myself!!!!! And you wouldn't want that to happen, 
        would you?!?!??!?! No, of course you flipping don't!!!!! So get cracking!!!!! 
      <p> OK, second things now!!!!! We've got another little re-directy address 
        now!!! Goto <a href="http://surf.to/seniordads/">http://surf.to/seniordads/</a> 
        for another way into your favourite website!!!! By which we of course 
        mean the Senior Dads site!!!!! And even better, using subdirs with <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org">http://seniordads.atari.org</a> 
        works!!!! So, to celebrate, given that this is issue 19, here's the lyrics 
        for that classic 1980s hit by Paul Hardcastle, 19!!!!!!!

          wanted to do a fabby-dabby spoofy filmy like that "Lethal Titanic" or 
          whatever it's called?!?!? Well, you might want to start by loading up 
          your Netscape/IE/AOL browsey-wowsey with frames and javascript!!!!!!!!!! 
          This is because someone's discovered that it's quite easy to "spoof" 
          a frames-using site with Javascript!!! Someone could make up a page 
          that looks a little like the site, and reload it in place of the real 
          page from the site, and make it do something like ask for your password, 
          and it's not obvious, because the URL in the top of the window points 
          to the frameset, not the newly reloaded page!!!! Er, well, at least 
          that's what they say here- I don't understand a word of it!!!!!! They 
          do have a nice demonstration page tho...

          the "net" columnist whose columns we keep seeing everywhere is obviously 
          getting a little out of his normal depth in his Slashdot columns, if 
          his latest is anything to go by!!!!! He's presumably getting a little 
          irked by the fact that the Slashdot format allows people to comment 
          on his columns right next to them, and that a lot of the audience know 
          a lot more about computing subjects than he does!!!!! So in his latest 
          column he's actually asking for help on Linux!!!! He's of course using 
          the opportunity to try and apply it to everyone else, and appeal to 
          knowledgeable people to not be so snotty and so on... but he's basically 
          asking for help!!!! 
          <p> Let's hope he gets it!!!! (Oooh-er crickey officer!!!!) After all, 
            his columns are reasonably well written, and are from a different 
            perspective than the usual "net" journo type stuff- so if he can learn 
            a bit more about "techhy" issues, it can only help things, can't it?!?!?!

          his relationship with Beavis!??!?!</font></a> 
        <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I suppose you're 
          waiting for me to say something like "Well, now I've got your attention, 
          here's the real story!!!!" or something crap like that!!!!! Well, I'm 
          not going to do that!!!! I really am going to talk about the relationship 
          between Beavis (out of "Beavis & Butthead") and Elvis Presley!!!! 
          <p> OK, here goes... Beavis is in "Beavis & Butthead", which was created 
            by Mike Judge. He appeared in the movie "Airheads" who also starred 
            Nina Siemaszko. She appeared in the move "The Long Way Home", which 
            also starred Ed Asner. And Ed Asner appeared in "Change of Habit", 
            with... (drum roll!!!) Elvis Presley!!!!!!!!!! 
          <p> Yes, it's that type of website!!!! In the "<b>Oracle of Elvis</b>" 
            website, you can type in any old name, and find out their connection 
            to "Mr Rock 'n' Roll Cheeseburger"!!!! Unfortunately, when I tried 
            to find out my connection to the very talented movie actor, it didn't 
            work!!!!! I'll have to email them to remind them that I of course 
            shouted "That Colonel Tom Parker will be the death of you!!!" at him 
            when I was a baggage attendant at Prestwick airport, which was coincidentelly 
            the scene of Presley's only UK "gig"!!!! He said something like "Sort 
            it out!!!", which I took to be an offer to be his new manager!!!!! 
            At which point some big bloke ran towards me looking a little angry, 
            then I saw a lot of stars, and when I woke up, Elvis had left the 
            building!!!!!! 
          <p> Incidentelly, if you've been watching the very nice cable channel 
            "Cartoon Network", you might have noticed that one of their adverts 
            uses a similar "connections" game- only it's not with Elvis, it's 
            with Thelma out of Scooby Doo!!!!! We wonder how long it's going to 
            be before their website does an "Oracle of Thelma"?!?!?!?

        <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What do you mean 
          you're sick of the Star Wars trailer already?!?!? Well, you have to 
          "unsick" yourselves!!!! If you're going to the cinema this Xmas, you're 
          probably going to be seeing it again!!!! It's going to appear in selected 
          UCI movie theatres from Dec 16!!! If you're going to a UCI cinema to 
          the see "<b>The Mask Of Zorro</b>", and you wonder why the queues to 
          get in are so incredibly long, then now you know!!!!!! 
          <p> You can spend the long hours waiting until that happens by downloading 
            "augmented" versions of the trailer from this helpful little site, 
            which includes mirrors to loadsa trailers as well as loads of "unusual" 
            versions, such as the "camcorder" one, and a "stereo pro-logic" version!!!!!!!!
