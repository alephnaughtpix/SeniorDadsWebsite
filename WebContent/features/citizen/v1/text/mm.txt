Dear Melody Maker....

Bllleeeuurrghaaarrgghh!!!

That was me just reading Melody Maker Aug 15 1998!!! I had a very nice
lunch at the cafe down the road, and I've now just lost it due
to the insensitivity of your photo editors in assembling the most unnerving collection of "images" ever seen in a single
publication!!!!! Including:

* A reject from "Grange Hill" on the front cover!!
* The Manic Street Preachers apparently suffering from hay fever!!
* Ewan MacGregor in a "70's" style- presumably a Martian 70's
  style!!!
* Martin Rossiter of Gene wearing earmuffs after an argument with a
  lawnmower!!!
* Some incredibly smug looking Jazz Club type, who turns out to
  be Michael Wells, formerly of Technohead and "I Wanna Be A Hippy"
  fame!!! (Nurse!!)
* Gorky's Zygotic Minic, who need a trip to the chiropodists as well
  as the hairdressers!!!
* Flick- the pic even had a space for a "Holly's Crap Snap" logo
  to go on it!!!
* Huey from Fine Young Criminals- just add a sweatband and he's Mark
  Knopfler!!!
* Puressence- when kids are taking the piddle out of you in your own
  flippin' photo, you know something's wrong!!!!
* And finally, how on earth did you get such a bad piccy of the Beach
  Boys!??! They look like a flippin' 70s folk band- there's even a
  dog in the pic!!!

Was this a complex ruse to make the Mansun photos look reasonable by
comparision!??! If so, it's succeeded!!! But only by turning MM into
the rock music journalism equivalent of "Saving Private Ryan"!!!!!!

Like the Kylie song, I'm "Shocked"!!!!!!!!

Yours blah blah,

Old Fart!
