<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">No we are not going to mention that "trailer"!!!!!!!
And we thought it would just be Linux geek propellor-head nerds who
would go on about it, but no!!!! I woke up this (Friday) morning, and saw
the flipping "Star Wars: Episode One/Phanton Menace" trailer being
shown on Breakfast TV!!!!!!!!! I almost choked on my porridge in
surprise!!!!!!!!!!!! So- no more mention of flipping Star Wars!!!!!!
<P>
Erm, OK then... We'll mention it once!!!!!!! But at least the
story is a little more interesting!!!!!!!!
<P>
OK, enough of the SW bull-doody!!!!!!!!!!! This is much more
important!!!!!! The first story in this issue is story no. 500!!!!
Yes, that's right!!!! We've now passed the 500 story mark with this
issue!!! Amazing, isn't it?!?!!? Those people who said when we
started that we couldn't last were wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Erm... Well...
Actually no-one's really said that, because not very many people
read Senior Citizen when it first came out!!!! But if anyone did
say that, they'd be wrong anyway!!!!!!! So there!!!!<P>
Oh, and another thing!!!!! As you might notice from one of the news
stories, you can't get through to <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/</a> <B>OR</B>
<a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> at the moment!!!!! Luckily Grelb hasn't
shut down or moved to a different server as they were threatening
recently, so the special "long" Grelb URL still works!!!!!!!! (Well,
at the moment, anyway!!!!!! Don't want to tempt fate!!!!!!)

          a mailing list, after which both websites disappeared, (See <a href="5.html#163">

Oddly enough, in the same week, all the *.atari.org domains, including our

company called Wireless International!!!!

By Friday tho, it was pointing to the <a href="http://www.kaliba-net.com/">http://www.kaliba-net.com/</a> , who host
some of the atari.org stuffs!!! A news item on <a href="http://www.atari.org/">http://www.atari.org/</a> explained
that there was a problem with the domain server, but they were nearly ready
to switch to their new server, so hopefully it won't be too long...

But, ouch!!!!! My Ears!!!!!! They're hurting from all you young people shouting: "But what
actually flippin' surfing the web!?!??!?!?!"!!!!!!!!!! Well, you can surf tha W3 using only
a single floppy disk!!!!!!!! Some of you might be saying at this point: "But, oh great and
wise Senior Dads, we don't have no ST or Amiga, or indeed any computer from the days when you
could fit Microsoft Word on a 720K disk!!!!!!!" Well, you don't need one of those, you can "do
it" (ooh-er!!!!!!!) using a normal PC and a floppy!!!!!!! At least, if it's from this lot...

on C4 Teletxt (p481)!!!! Apparently Tony Scott is producing a TV series based on
that funny vampire movie he made in the early 80s called "The Hunger"!!!!!! And
the main star of that film, David Bowie is apparently to host each episode!!!!
We saw this news repeated on the gossip section of Club 140 (p143), adding that
it's going to be shown on the Sci-Fi channel, so it must be true!!!!!!
<P>
We wonder if it'll be anything like this series we've seen on the Sci-Fi channel
over the past year... Oddly enough, it's also called "The Hunger", and it's
based on the film by Tony Scott, but this one is actually produced by *<b>all</B>*
the Scott brothers, including Ridley and Jake as well as Tony, and it's hosted
by Terence Stamp not David Bowie, so it can't possibly be the same series, can
it!??!? And having seen the series, we say: just as well, because the one we've
seen isn't really very good!!!! And this reviewer person agrees with us!!!!

going to get confused with the existing Terence Stamp one, and we can't have
that!!! So here's an episode guide for the not-so-good series!!!!

in the album credits as "The Ape"!!!!!!! It's a fabby little album which shows

memory, you'll know that this past week the first trailer for the new Star Wars
movie started appearing in US cinemas!!! Ever since, the trailer's also been
appearing all over the Internet!!!! The most popular versions are the Quicktime
and AVI files from the official Star Wars website, but we've seen a version of
the trailer shot in a cinema by some bloke with a camcorder, complete with
rather appreciative noises coming from the audience!!!!!
<P>
One of the major groups responsible for spreading the trailer has been the
dudes from Slashdot!!!!! One of their articles, posted a couple of days after
the trailer started showing in US cinemas, noted that versions of the
trailer were available from a couple of sites, and listed them!!!! Then loads
of people added comments saying that they had mirror sites set up themselves!!!
So this article suddenly became an index for all the mirror sites to the
trailer!!!!!! Which is just as well, because due to massive demand, it's almost
impossible to download the trailer from the official Star Wars site!!!!!
<P>
(Mysteriously enough, this article disappeared from the Slashdot menu the
very next day!!!!! But the article itself still remained!!!! Perhaps the
Slashdot lot got a call from a certain film campany?!?!?!?)
<P>

The easy availabilty of the trailer on the Internet probably explains why on
the day after the Slashdot article the bits of the trailer were being shown
on various TV news programs around the world!!!!!!!
