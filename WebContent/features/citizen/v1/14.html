      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, again I don't 
      have too much to write here!!!!! The main reason I've done too much yet 
      is that I'm just starting on a lovely little "re-education" course about 
      learning how to use Windows NT!!!!! Considering that the next versh of NT 
      (5!!!) is going to the official Windows 2000 (As announced this Tuesday!), 
      I would say that this is time well spent- and the chance of getting a nice 
      pay packet is not too off-putting either!!!!!!! 
      <P>
Anyway, as you might have noticed, there's going to be no mention of
that film that they keep going on about on the TV!!!!! If you think
I'm going to do any promotion of a film where that MacGregor chappie
doing a poor impersonation of Iggy Pop in one of those films made by
people who like to pretend that 70s were better than they actually
were!!!!! Well, believe it or not, the 70s weren't that brilliant!!!!
It might surprise younger readers for me to say this, but people did
not dress like extras from a Pulp video!!!! And the music
was pretty terrible as well!!!! When the highlight in a 70s TOTP is
Abba knocking Manhattan Transfer off the number 1 spot (And that was in
1977- right in the middle of punk!!!!), you know something's wrong
somewhere!!!!!! I don't know what 1970s these "media" types are
referring to as "fashionable", but I can safely say that people were
fashionable in the 70s in the same way that people were hippies in
the 1960s!!!!! (ie not at all for 99% of the population!!!!!)
<P>Ah well!!!! I suppose MacGregor can afford to pick crappy roles!!!!
After all, by this time next year, he'll probably be forever known
as Mr Anakin Skywalker!!!!!

Russians to put mirrors in space to reflect sunlight, and turn night "off"

The last time we talked about this, the big plans were off because they
didn't have enough money!!!! Then some time after, all this Russian Financial
Crisis business started, so we thought that was definately it- no more
"mirrors in space" plans now!!!!! So we were a bit surprised to find out that
the plans are suddenly back on!!!!! Only thing is, they've been cut down a
bit... Now there's only one mirror getting sent up!!!!! But if it works,
they're planning on sending a couple more up!!!!!

by the BBC, who won because it was completely untrue!!!!!!!!! (Which is why we've got to keep
saying that it's completely untrue, even though it is completely untrue anyway!!!!!!)
<P>
Well, it looks like it's happening again in the US- with the Teletubbies!!!!!! Some US parents
are listening to their kids Teletubbies dolls, and are hearing swearwords!!! Especially the
baby of the bunch, Po, who, according to who you talk to, is saying, "fagot,fogot,fagot", or
"bite my butt!!!"!!!!! And Tinky Winky apparently even encourages drug use!!!!!!

First Po is not cursing... She is say Fi-dit, fi-dit, fi-dit mar, mar,
man... Which means faster faster faster... Slower slower slower... and she
sings that when she is on her scooter which makes sense... I sorry for your
daughter that she is losing out on the enjoyment of a educationalt tv
show... She deserves quality entertainment... There is nothing wrong with
the show and it is not sick... it is actually well put together and full of
lessons... Again agian is NATURAL for children... that is when mom steps in
and say no... May be you too have a lot to learn from teletubbies... Also
each Tubby is a different nationality and personality... that teaches
children that we can all live together in peace no matter what skin color we
are or type of person we are as long as w all give each other "BIG Hugs" we
will all be happy... You should look at the teletubbies website and learn
about them instead of assuming that they are bad... Anyway I wisj you and
your daughter good luck... But I am glad we ( my daughter and I) FOund
teletubbies... She is so excited each time I turn it on the smile Makes me
happy to see her enjoy learning...
<P>
Good Luck,
Take Care,

Well, in future, we will know what printer driver to use, because it'll be the same printer
