<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I'm writing this little bit on tha Fri 13th!!!!!!!!! Woo!!!! I
thought all that guff about it being unlucky was, erm, guff!!!! But when I
was on that little NT course that I'm on, all of the NT computers refused to
work properly!!!!! And then I decided to take an afternoon nap, and when I
woke up, it was late and every one had gone home!!!!! And I hadn't even
finished this issue!!!! So after about an hour spent getting my disk out of
the funny disk drive on the computer, I let myself out of the room, and then
got stopped by the security people , and had to spend an inordinate amount
of time explaining why I wasn't a burglar!!!!! Then I ran to the bus stop,
and found I'd missed the bus!!!!!!! Then the secod bus got hit by a
meteorite!!!!! So I had to walk home!!!!!!!! I've just arrived, and there's
only 5 more minutes of this day to go, so at least not much can go wrong
now!!! so, without furTHER ADO, HERE'S THE NEXT ISSUE OF sENIOR cITIZEN...
Argh!!!!!!!!!!!!

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What's on the 
          web and quacks!??!?!?! Well, according to this news story, some doctors!!!! 
          A lot of "proper" doctors have come to the surprising conclusion that 
          some "cyberdoc" wesbites are run by quacks, and have warned that they 
          might get it wrong!!!!!! For example one "doc" recommended 'two bowel 
          movements', whilst another suggested 'Red Clover and Dandelion', which 
          was oddly enough available from the "Doc" at a small cost!!!!! One even 
          suggested 'two apples a day', which is really stupid, since as everyone 
          knows, "an apple a day...", so two apples is like a polite way of telling 
          your patient to "rack off"!!!!! (As they say in those Australian soaps!!!!!!!)

          it to a couple of million megs!!!! The UKs largest web cache has just 
          opened to help ISPs store web pages frequently accessed by their users, 
          and it can store a terabyte of data!!!!!!! One of the people behind 
          this seems really enthusiastic about it: <I>"A terabyte represents an 
          incredible amount of storage. For instance, if a book were to contain 
          the same amount of information, it would be 32,000 feet high - taller 
          than Mount Everest,"</I>!!!!!

          are!!!!!!!!!!!! They're called <B>Future Lawyers Alliance Network (FLAN)</B>!!!!!!

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After Jon Katz 
          stopped writing for Hotwired, (See <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</A>...) 
          we thought we wouldn't see too much of him after that, but the opposite 
          has happened!!!!!!! In fact, a whole load of sites we visit regularly 
          now have Jon Katz columns!!!!! First, there was the Freedom Forum site, 
          then the Newstrolls column (See <a href="11.html#321"> issue 11</A>...) 
          .... Now he's on Slashdot!!! It started when he did some column on the 
          Freedom Forum site about Slashdot publicising the MS "Halloween Memo" 
          (See <a href="15.html#449"> issue 15</A>...) ...

          <P> Slashdot linked to this, and all the usual geek propellor-head nerds 
            slagged Katz off for getting some technical thingies wrong, so he 
            was invited to do an "upgraded version" for Slashdot!!!!!!

          <P> But near the end of this week, <I>another</I> column by Katz appeared!!!! 
            Is this going to be a regular thing, we wonder?!?!?!?!

          a failure of speculation on the physical nature of a component being 
          addressed" is something interesting!!!!!!!!! I'm not exactly sure what 
          it does, but you can be sure that this time next year, the phrase "Memory 
          controller for a microprocessor for detecting a failure of speculation 
          on the physical nature of a component being addressed" will be on everyone's 
          lips!!!!!!!

          <P> This lot here apparently know what the "Memory controller for a 
            microprocessor for detecting a failure of speculation on the physical 
            nature of a component being addressed" actually does!!!!!!!!!!!

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">According to this 
          UK Net survey, a lot of people in the UK think that the internet is 
          still a lot like "Killer Net"!!!! Only, unlike most people, they're 
          taking "Killer Net" seriously, and not as the corking parody of bad 
          "Net" programmes that it really is!!!!! Apparently they think tha mighty 
          inpho-webby thingy corrupts morals, and is devoted to pictures of people 
          "doing it!!!!!!!!!!
