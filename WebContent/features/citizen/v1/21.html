<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Wow!!!!! Who would have guessed that we would have made it
to 1999?!?!?!? Erm, well, I would have!!!!!! Because I had to write this
issue!!!!!!!! Even more amazing, it's our 21st issue!!!!! That means as
a magazine, Senior Citizen is now old enough to become an MP!!!!!!!!
<P>
Anyway, I've got a couple of new years resolutions as regards Senior
Citizen...
<OL>
<LI>Do a bit of re-designing on the general look!!!!!!
<LI>Make the archive section a bit better!!!!
<LI>Get a slightly more reliable mailing list for the email version
    of Senior Citizen!!!!!!!
</OL>
I'm also intending to make my own side of the making of an issue a bit
easier and more convenient!!!!! (That would a good thing!!!!) I'll be
doing a couple of tests of the mini re-design soon, but I'll tell you
nearer the time!!!!!!!!!!
<P>
So, happy new year and all that!!!!!!! Now read the first issue of
1999!!!!

letting users make their own radio stations on tha inphopipe highway
netweb thingy!!!!! Even more significantly, (We're using big words
today, aren't we!!!!!!) it looks like <B>Realaudio</B>'s dominance
in the webby audio streaming department is under threat!!!!
<P>
It's all thanks to this thingy called <B>Shoutcast</B> by Nullsoft-
that's right it's the people behind <B>Winamp</B>!!!! What they've
done is added a plugin to Winamp that allows whatever you're playing
on Winamp (Whether it's MP3s, WAVs, MODs, YMs, etc.) to be streamed
to a special Shoutcast server anywhere on tha netweb!!!!! Even better,
you can download a server for Windows, and broadcast to the web on
the same computer you're playing Winamp on!!!!! For you non-Windows
peeps, there's also server proggies for quite a few non-wintel platforms...
And it's all for free as well!!!!!!
<P>
<a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/">http://www.shoutcast.com/</a>
<P>
This idea has really caught the Slashdot crowd on the hop- they're
looking for ways to take the Windows part out of the equation...
<P>

<P>
At the time of writing, we've been sampling (!!!!) some of the stations
in the Shoutcast directory... By default all Shoutcast servers tell
the main Shoutcast directory if they're broadcasting or not... (Which
is quite handy if you're a Trading Standards person, and want to find
out who's broadcasting copyrighted music on tha netweb without
permission!!!!!!) In amongst the top 10 we found this little beauty!!!
<B>Sub Ether Radio</B> broadcast whole uncut episodes of <B>The
Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy</B>!!!!!! (And apparently they appear
to be broadcasting the original radio episodes, rather than the
versions released on the record...

          <P>
Another interesting station (And one which is a bit more legit!!!!!)
is <B>MP3.com</B>'s Top 40 Countdown, where you can hear loadsa
unsigned acts on MP3.com's archives, which is really great, as you
can listen to such jolly tunes as <B>X-Clan</B>'s
"F&$ked up world"!!!!!! (A brilliant reason if there ever
was one!!!!!)

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Talking of MP3.com, 
          you might remember that some time ago we mentioned one of their stranger 
          artists, some dude called <B>Chuckie Dogg Fresh</B>, who talked an awful 
          lot about "bitches" and "mo fo" people on his album "The Shit Is Wack"!!!!! 
          (See <a href="14.html#426"> issue 14</A>...) Well, we've seen his page 
          on mp3.com again recently, and there's been a couple of changes!!!! 
          For a start, the album has been renamed "This Shit *<B>Be</B>* Wack", 
          and for another, the Dogg's piccy has gone!!!! Presumably this is because 
          the "Dogg" feels that he'll get less of a slagging off from "homies" 
          who think he is a tad patronising if he doesn't put up any pic of himself!!!!!!!!! 
          <P>
Well, he's now got an alter-ego in the reggae section, called
<B>Chuck Rastaboyee Fresh</B>!!!!! And in his "Nicely Stylin'", he's

your video recorder, (Like forgetting where the record button is, or

<B>ReplayTV</B> is a spiffy little "short-term" video recorder that
is able to work by itself!!!!!! That's because it uses loads of
computer stuff, and it doesn't record on a video tape- it record
programs on a hard drive!!!!!!!!! (That's why it's "short-term",
presumably!!!!!!!!!) It also connects with the Replay site on tha
inphopipe highweb, to find out when programs are, so you can record
a proggy, and then say to the videobox thingy to record all future
episodes... And it'll get the details from the Replay site, and
record them!!!! You can even get it to search for unknown programs
of a specific genere (eg sci-fi, cop drama, thrash metal, etc.), and
it'll find them and record it for you, so you can have your own
special "Old Fart" telly channel!!!!
<P>
How long before this sort
of thing blurs with the Internet, and we have a telly equivalent of
<B>Imagine Radio</B> or <B>Shoutcast</B> on tha netweb?!?!?!
