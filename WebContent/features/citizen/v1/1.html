the game, and adjust itself!!! Well, the guys at MIT are working on
it!!! According to the link below, "researchers at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab are working on
computers that can "read" a person's mind by monitoring body movements."
Unfortunately, being the boring people that they are, they're
using it for more serious stuff like "effective tutors" or video
recorders that "sense your boredom and fast-forward through the dull
parts of a movie", but I'm sure you can see the interesting
applications!!! One prob tho- if Windows gets hold of that sort of
technology, and reads people reactions to it, I can imagine it

(presumably the person behind the server!!) posted a message called
"I'm from Heaven's Gate" on <a href="news://alt.conspiracy">news://alt.conspiracy</a> with just the URL for the

one apparently will add a couple of lines to your autoexec.bat

Well, I think it's funny!!! Apparently the guys behind "Independence
Day" are wanting to put the "President" character from there into an
"Incredible Journey" remake!!! The heroes of the film get shrunk in
"ZX Shrink Chamber"!!!!! (Actually, it looks like this rumour is a load
of crap, but I still like the idea of a ZX Shrink Chamber!!!)

This is certainly giving us a few ideas for our "Killer Nut" section!!
There are now a couple of "write your own adventure story" sites- you
remember those "do your own thing" type books where you came to some
conundrum at the end of one page and you've got to turn to page xx
according to what decision you make and so on?!?!? Well, it's pretty
easy to do on the web!!! And now they can be self writing!!! On the
one below if you get to the end of a path, you can add your own bit and
choices to it!!!

OK, this is an old one, but I was reminded of it in this months Fortean
Times... You've probably heard of that book "The Bible Code" by Michael
Drosnin, where he says the Bible predicts this, that, and everything
else inbetween!!! Now, some people think it's just chance that certain
letters equally spaced between each other just happen to make well known
names and stuff!!! In his defence Drosnin said "When my critics find a
message about the assassination of a prime minister encrypted in Moby
Dick, I'll believe them". This is a reference to the claim that the
assassination of Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin was predicted in the Bible!!!
Well, someone's taken him up on it!!!! And they've found loadsa
people in Moby Dick, including Yitzhak Rabin, who were assassinated after
the book was published!!!

It seems that the latest challenge in demos, after the craze earlier
in the year for 128 byte demos (Check <a href="../../../demos/dadplazz.html">ours</A> out!!!) is system friendly
demos!!! The Black Lotus have already done a Windows 95 demo
and now some guys on our favourite platform have done an Atari GEM
demo!! You'll need an 68030 Atari with 16bit graphics (eg a Faclon!!)
to run it though!!! What's really interesting about this one is that
the crew are working on a third party module format so that others
can slot in their own demo modules!!! See </font><a href="http://wombat.ludvika.se/gemdemo/<P></font>"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">http://wombat.ludvika.se/gemdemo/<P></font></a>

There's a new MP3 player just getting underway called "FreeAMP"- Yep,
that's right!!! It's "Free", because it's GPLed. If you dunno what that
means, it just means you get the source code with it!!! This is how they
usually do things in the world of Unix, but this proggy is done for
Windows as well as Unix/Linux!!! At the moment, it's still in a very
early stage- there ain't no binary versions, so you have to have the
right tools to compile it for Windows!! But since you get the right tools
supplied with Linux as standard, it should be no prob there!!! Anyway,
it's worth keeping an eye on- hopefully when my WinAmp player has run out,
they'll have done a binary version!!!!

Great!!! Our "<a href="../../..//demos/mono/mono.html">Monomental</A>" demo really gets a slagging in the lastest
issue of Undercover, the Atari diskmag!!! It seems that Moondog has
decided not to like our demos after all!!! Ah well, we couldn't get
brilliant reviews all our lives!!! Actually, Moondog suddenly seems to
be against all "fake" demos- why he's included us in it we don't know
since we're art terrorist multimedia gurus, not a "fake demo" crew!!
Mind you, the poor bloke seems to be negative these days about
everything!!!! Anyway, have a look at UCM12- it's at
<a href="http://wombat.ludvika.se/ae/dhs_files/misc/ucm12.lzh">http://wombat.ludvika.se/ae/dhs_files/misc/ucm12.lzh</a>
It's an Atari prog, but PC dads can run it under Pacifist!!! (we
run it under v0.44) You'll probably need anti-depressant drugs after
reading it tho!! You can get Pacifist from
<a href="http://www.pacifist.fatal-design.com/">http://www.pacifist.fatal-design.com/</a> . You can also run our "Monomental" demo in Pacifist (Put it in hi-res mode!!)!!! Get the demo from <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org/demos/mono/mono.html">http://seniordads.home.ml.org/demos/mono/mono.html</a> and decide for yourself!!!!<P></font>

Scientists this week decoded the first confirmed alien transmission from
outer space. Here is the text of the message that they decoded:

"THIS REALLY WORKS!!!!!!!!!

Just send 5*10*50 atoms of hydrogen to each of the five star systems
listed below. Then, add your own system to the top of the list, delete
the system at the bottom, and send out copies of this message to 100
other solar systems. If you follow these instructions, within 0.25 of
a galactic rotation you are guaranteed to receive enough hydrogen in
return to power your civilization until entropy reaches its maximum!"</PRE></div></TD></TR></font></TABLE><P>
