on 31st December 1999, and get a satellite link to Fiji!!! Because
it's just off the International Date Line, it's 12 hours ahead of
GMT time, so the Y2K probs will hit there first!!! People in Fiji
are making some money from this by advertising itself as the advance

the communications equipment there is not Y2K compatible!?!?!

Yes there sure is ! Attach one end of a garden hose to your rear end,then attach the other end to your coffee maker and
toaster.When you wake in the morning your breakfast will be cooked for you !

programs on 16-bit machines called <B>demos</B>!!! They're not the
half-finished games you get on magazine coverdisks as you might think!!!!
They're actually really spiffy little audio-visual experiences done for fun,
like the ones we do!!!! One of the first demos I saw was this amazingly
spangly little production on my little ST in 1989 called "<B>The Union
Demo</B>" with loads of whizzy effects!!!! Well, in 1998, someone called
<B>Demografica</B> has decided to convert it to the PC!!!! At the moment
all tht's been done is conversion of some of the chip music and graphics,
but surely it can't be that hard to convert all the "rasters",
"fullscreens", and "bitmap scrollers" to the PC and all it's supey-dupey
graphics and sound capabilities!!!

You can already run the original Atari version (mostly) on the PC thanks to
Pacifist ST emulator... Well, I say "original"- it's actually a version of
the demo cracked by the infamous ST demo-rippers <B>Ripped Off</B>, and put
on a compilation menu by <B>Persistance of Vision</B> some time in the early
1990s!!! The really wierd thing is that you can't get an *<I>original</I>*
copy of the Union demo over the Internet because the original version was in
a wierd custom disk format that could not be copied by any disk copier on the
ST!!!! It could only be copied by an inbuilt copier program included with
the actual demo!!!! This means it couldn't be spread by any other means,
including bulletin boards and FTP!!!!!! Really thinking ahead, weren't
they?!?!?!?!

went better than the dudes at the distinguished computing magazine
<B>Byte</B>!!!! Their proprietors just turned up and said said: Byte's
closed, and you're all sacked- you've got one day to clear your desk,
goodbye!!!! Well, there was probably more to it than that, but it sounds
just like what happened to me after I produced that documentary
"The Wonderful Story of Thrash Metal" for Radio 2!!!!!!!

Hollywood scandals!!! Then there was <B>Rock 'n' Rock Babylon</B>, a book by
Kenneth Anger on rock 'n' rock scandals!!!! Now there's <B>Linux Babylon</B>,
which, erm, rather disappointingly is not a book by Kenneth Anger on scandal
in the Slashdot crowd, but a new linux-based game platform thingy which is
supposed to be geared towards making games programming easy and so on...
Apparently you just boot this "Babylon" system up, and then run the game on
top of it!!! It uses all the usual Linux library type stuff like Glide,
SVGAlib, MEDlib, etc., ... It's in an early stage, but it's an interesting
idea!!
<P>
We can't really see any established games companies actually taking it
up to be honest, but it might be really popular with the free-software
types, and indeed "bedroom" programmers who are getting increasingly shut out
of the games business by proprietary standards!!!!! (Ooooh!!! Aren't we being
political this week!!!!) The people behind this hope to port to it other
UNIX "flavours", which would make porting games to other hardware platforms
pretty easy!!!

and expensive study in the US and found out that people spend
all their time in front of the computer are more likely to
be lonely!!!!!! And because of that they're less likely to
be happy!!!! So in summary- heavy internet users are sad lonely
geeks!!! Apparently the people who put 1.5 million dollars to
find out this shock finding are a bit cheesed off as they thought
the survey would say the exact opposite!!!!! But the people that
got the money to do the survey (Called "HomeNet"- tells you quite
a lot, doesn't it?!?!?) must be laughing!!!!
<P>
Be careful- apparently clicking this link may make you ONE PER-CENT
MORE DEPRESSED and 0.4 PER-CENT MORE LONELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, one bunch 
          who are going to be a bit annoyed by the above survey are the internet 
          commerce dudes, who according to the following article are depending 
          on the emotions of the average web-surfer!!! Apparently they're using 
          stuff like brand names and nice web-sites to make the surfers happy 
          to part with their money!!! The only problem is that now you can get 
          internet shopping search engines (See <a href="6.html#188"> issue 6</A>...) 
          to search for the lowest price, which throws their strategy out of the 
          window!!!!!! So I reckon if "HomeNet" did a survey on them, it would 
          be found that working in Internet commerce makes you more depressed!!!!!

about him, so it was only a matter of time beforew there was a
massive backlash!!!!! I'm of course talking about <B>Harry Knowles</B>
and his movie rumours website <B>Ain't It Cool News</B>!!!! There was
some rumblings over the news about Peter Jackson and the Lord of the
Rings trilogy and Harry's enthusiastic reaction (Isn't he always
enthusiastic!??!?!) and then the news that Peter Jackson was going to
answer readers questions about the films on the site... Then his
week his site went one movie rumour too far and posted some rumours
seen in the UK movie free mag "Flicks" to the effect that the Star
Wars movie had been delayed!!! As many people suspected, this was
a crap mag just retelling an old rumour, but in the talkback section
accompanying the article turned into a complete slag-off of the whole
site, with loads of people going right ahead and calling a Harry "full
of shit" and a "sellout"!!! Not that they're jealous of the site or
Harry's new found fame or anything...

          <P> Personally I don't think the site has changed that much since the revamp in 
            story terms... Harry always used to go on about everything being "cool", 
            and I'm pretty sure older readers remember the "ZX Shrink Chamber" 
            story appearing the in the first issue of Senior Citizen- that was 
            an untrue story as well!!! (See <a href="1.html#20"> issue 1</A>...) 
            The main difference is the adding of the "talkback" section to the 
            articles, giving free-rein to anyone that wants to slag off Harry 
            and his burgeoning celebrity status!!!
