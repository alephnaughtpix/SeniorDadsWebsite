      nothing else I can think of yet!!!!!! Argh!!!!!!! 
      <P>
OK then, I have thought of something... By the end of 1998, I'll be wanting
to do some sort of review of the year (Alright then, half year!!!!!!) so start
thinking of your favourite stories so far, and I'll be asking you readers
(especially you bunch in the mailing list!!!!) in a month or two to name your
fave rave!!!!! (OK, fave story then!!!!!!!) So start looking!!!!

"actually doing it"!!!!! In fact, according to <B>.net</B> magazine's
completely made-up statistic quoted in the prog 95% of the people in the
Internet are "doing it"!!!!!! (By which of coure we mean searching for
pictures of people "doing it", not actually "doing it" themselves!!!!!) But
it turns out that those 95% might be better at actually "doing it" for
real!!!! This is because, as someone said, "doing it" for real gets better
with practice, and what better way of practising than "doing it" in virtual
reality!??!?! Actually, I'm not sure this is a good idea!!!!! I saw some
"late-night" movie on Sky on this subject recently, and there was this
"cyberpunk" type dude who kept saying things like "Holy gigabyte!!!!!" This
is not the sort of thing I'd like to see encouraged in young people!!!!!

is in the "thing's" own language, called <B>Furbish</B>, which it

easier to install stuff on a networked computer rather than installing
it from a CD every time!!!! Presumably this is in response to the increased

this really spiffy personal 200 Mbits/second packet radio connection

as well as 291.27 quid!!! (That Yahoo! Exchange Rate section is really
informative isn't it?!?!?!?!?) The only prob is that here in the UK, the
fuddie-duddies at the Radio Authority porbably won't like the idea of

It certainly give a new meaning to "Internet Radio" tho!!!!!!!!!!

        Anyway, you can download his "art" in mp3 format, but if you can't
        be bothered with that, then it's okay, because he puts the lyrics to
        his songs on the websote!!! And of course, the lyrics are really
        important, because he's a "singer-songwriter" and writes really
        meaningful songs!!!!! So of course loads of people are going to want
        to read song lyrics from a complete stranger they've never heard

        the website about his DJ "Crew", including detailed biogs which
        including their real names, which is really funny!!!!!! Then you
        can toddle over to their RealAudio "Mix" section, and listen to the

        Really "Slammin'"!!!!!!<P>
