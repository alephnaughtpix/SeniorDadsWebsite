<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The mailing list works!!!!! Only one prob- it's very very sllloooowww!!!!! By
the time you'll read this, it'll probably be Saturday or something!!! I'm
getting a little proggy together that might speed up the mailing, so by
next week, I might have some interesting news for you readers!!! I'm also
testing the new(er) look, and it'll hopefully be ready by the next issue
as well!!! So, you'd better hold onto your seats next weekend after next
weekend, and keep the heart pills at the ready!!!!
<P>
Er, BTW, when I say "next weekend after next weekend", I mean it!! I'm having
a little mini holiday from Wed 29 Jul - Sat 1 Aug, so no issue then because
I'll not have collected enough guff for anything apart from a very very
tiny issue!!! So next issue is probably out on Aug 7/8th!!! See you then!!!

on Saturday as apparently their ISP pulled the plug on it!!! Then it
re-appeared later in the day on a different ISP!!! According to the
original ISP hoster, the site's a hoax!!! (Wow, that was a bit hard
to guess, wasn't it!??!) Apparently the man behind the site was
intending to charge viewers 5 dollars to view, and then "Mike" and
"Diane" would decide *not* to do it!!!! Apparently this was a plot
to annoy the hell (!!!) out of religious fundy types and say something
about safe sex and make money all at the same time!!!!!

But it gets better!!! As soon as the "new" site went up, it was
broken into by a hacker called "MagicFX", who deleted the entire
site, and replaced it with a slaggy message to the man behind it!!!

Earlier this week "Mike" and "Diane" came forth from the shadows to
reveal themselves as Ty Taylor, a 23 yo actor, and Michelle Parma (of
unspecified age!!) who's appeared in some MTV show or something, and
guess wot!!! They're neither 18 or virgins!!!

those Real dudes and Microsoft are paying as well!!! It's not just
gimmicky display site either- there's like real actual dance music

that for some wacky reason, they're pumping out the sound at a really loud

There's two URLs I've seen for this thingy, but they don't really lead
anywhere!!! Maybe they will soon, I heard of it on Sunday, which is
<I>before</I> the first issue is supposed to go out!!! But ATM it isn't
out!!! And I don't know when it's out!!!!! Erm!!!
<P>BTW When I heard of it on Sunday, it was courtesy of an
interview with it's editor in a Sunday broadsheet- it's online at <a href="http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/98/07/19/stiecoeco03003.html?1334425">http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/98/07/19/stiecoeco03003.html?1334425</a> !!!!
And that's without an issue!!! Senior Citizen has already released released 3
issues- the broadsheets really ought to be beating a path to our doors!!!!
<P>
<a href="http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.htm">http://www.gamerush.com/str/fronts.htm</a> - This appears to be just an advert
for the thingy plus an addr to subscribe to (presumably an ASCII versh), but I hope the finished product doesn't look like that!! Especially since, according to the interview, the editor is a " co-partner in a web design and game
design agency"!!!

<a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com</a> - ATM this has some message along the lines

<P><B>Update (24/7/98)</B>- It's still not appeared, but now there's a little message on the first link saying "Late transmition to allow the competition to exhaust themselves !" I hope they're not exhausted even before they begin!!!<P></font>

actually a wireless local area network being developed by Carnegie Mellon
Uni!!! Apparently, the network is set up a bit like a cellphone type network,
and can handle 2 megabits of data a sec!!! Now, that would be a pretty
impressive network to connect your little palm computer to!!! The
name "Wireless Andrew" apparently refers to Andrew Carnegie and Andrew
Mellon, who, yup!, founded Carnegie Mello uni!!!

the "nominations", I'm not too surprised!!! I mean, how about "The Decade

"Age of Information"- but at least it's a bit nearer the mark!!!

is working with a few of the search engine to keep track of the sites
that people actually select from search results, so that they can keep
tabs on what's really relevant to people in search results!! Only prob I
can see with that... what if different things are relevant in searches
according to which country you come from or the language you speak and
so on!?!? If people from the UK are looking for things to rub out pencil
marks, they'll type "rubbers" into a search engine, and get condom sites

Just in case you're wondering, this is different from the Rialto

it from an Internet site, it's not an MP3, it's just an ordinary single
that you buy over the Internet!!!
