<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This a lot later than I expected!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's because I was upgrading
some of the system on the Senior Dads Linux box "<B>Godzilla</b>"!!!!!!!!
We had to get a lot of things fixed on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, our fave
Tux Box (!!!!! In fact, it's our only one!!!!!!!!!!!!!) is now running that
spiffy desktop for Linux, <B>KDE</B>!!!!! It's great!!!!!!!!!! It's like the
nice GUI features of Windows, but it's based on a stable operating which
doesn't crash all the time!!!!!!!! (I've heard at <B>ZDnet</B> have had a
similarly nice time when they were reviewing Linux!!!!!!!!!!! Apparently they
were really amazed that it didn't crash at all while they were reviewing
it!!!!!!!!) <P>
Anyway, that's why it's a week late!!!!!!!!!!!!! What is that you're saying:
you thought it was two weeks late!??!?!?! Well, I was attempting to add a
network card in my computers that week!!!!!!!!!!!! It was an extremely
hard job- and when I get the bloody thing working, I'll let you know in a
future issue of Senior Citzen!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, here was the editorial I
wrote a week ago....
<P>
Pah!!!!!! Valentine's day!!!!!! Who needs it!?!??!?!?!? If you thought Xmas
or Easter was a bit commercialised, then you've obviously forgotten about
this day!!!!!!!!!! Is there really anything to Valentines day other than
buying some crappy card or box of chocolates?!?!?!?! (Both of which are at
hiked-up prices!!!!!!!) Not that I can see!!!!!!!! You can do that any time
of the year, so why is 14th February so flippin' special?!?!?!? I mean, I
know it's traditional, but you could say the same about slavery or
diptheria, and I don't see too many people mourning the passing of either,
do you?!?!?!?!?!? And this "anonymous" business is really stupid as well!!!!
If you really want to have it off with someone, how on Earth can you
do "it" without knowing who the other flippin' person is, or vice-versa?!?!
Even in the non-"having it off" stakes, sending cards anonymously to
someone hardly amounts to what I would call a flippin' healthy romantic
relationship!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</FONT><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">
What do you mean "You're listening to that anti-Valentine compil CD that came
free with this week's <b>Melody Maker</b>, aren't you!!!!!!!"!?!??!?!? Erm,
well, yes, but it's actually a really good one!!!!! I mean, I don't exactly
remember the last time MM gave away a free tape or CD which included Fear
Factory and Sepultura, as opposed to the usual tepid indie bollocks!!!!!!!
Probably the best giveaway from MM since their infamous "Romo" tape!!!!!!

          check this one out!!!!!!!! Here's the opening para from a recent article 
          entitled "Cracking the Mind of the hacker": 
          <UL><I>"The average computer cracker is an obsessive

Yup, sounds like a completely reasonable unbiased non-hysterical statement to
us as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, surprisly, some crackers/hackers/whatever
Wired decides to call them these days!!!/who cares?!?!? are a little put out

          be used to the "AM"-like sound quality of RealAudio, but if you've tried 
          to actually get visual stuff going on your player, you'll know that 
          the resulting pictures look a little like what you would get if you 
          filmed the televison on a cheap camcorder with a plastic bag over the 
          lens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, apparently some people called <B>High 
          Speed Net Solutions</B> have fixed that problem with a way of sending 
          much clearer pictures over tha NetWeb with an average frame rate of 
          30 fps!!!!! Apparently it uses "wavelet-based technology" or something 
          like that!!!!!!! What with this, and Shoutcast challenging RealAudio's 
          dominance of streaming audio, (See <a href="21.html#614"> issue 21</A>...) 
          it looks like RealNetworks are going to have to pull their socks up!!!!!!!!!!!!!

erm, <B>Yahoo Suck!</B>, and it's a web portal.... Erm, a little bit like
Yahoo!!!!! You might think "What the feck (!!!!!) is the point of
that?!?!??!?", but apparently this accepts a lot of the sites that Yahoo won't
or can't accept, because they're too naughty, or they've forgotten about them,
or can't be bothered, or whatever excuse they give!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          <P> Well, this one is a little different!!!!!!!!! One of the sections one it's 
            front page is "<B>Internet Sex</B>"!!!!!!!!! What's really funny is 
            that at the time of writing, this heading has a little icon next to 
            it- it's the icon from "Zing!"!!!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="10.html#312"> 
            issue 10</A>...) We don't know how long this icon is going to last!!!!!!!!!!! 
            Mind you, we don't know how long the entire site is going to last, 
            given that Yahoo has already launched legal action against a "French 
            tobacco" site called <B>Yahooka</B>!!!!!!! But we think this lot are 
            really sound!!!!!!!!!! After all, their site uses <B>MySQL</B>, the

            So they must be really intelligent!!!!!!!!

That's because finally someone's actually worked out how to do 3D telly

<P>
Now, before you think I've been reading one of those old sci-fi magazines, I
have to tell you that this time someone's actually made it work!!!!!
Apparently all you need is a backlit LCD screen, and a special holographic
pattern!!!!!!! This pattern splits the image on the LCD screen into two images
which travel to each eye seperately, just like with a static hologramme!!!!!
So, you can send two perspected 3D images to the screen- and you'll see the 3D
effect!!!!!!!!
<P>
As with a static hologramme, you generally have to be in front of the telly to
get the 3D effect, but then if you're watching "Red Dwarf" from the flippin'
kitchen, then I wouldn't exactly think that you're too interested in the 3D
effects!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It'll be quite amusing tho to watch Rimmer say
he's a "hard light" hologramme- when we're watching him as a "soft light"
hologramme!!!!!!!!!!!!

accounts of the seemingly unrelenting wave of Internet deals.
<LI>"A page from online auction house eBay and cyberspace offerings from more
traditional retailers such as Spiegel and Victoria's Secret. The latter
hosted a much-ballyhooed webcast of a lingerie fashion show."

the one where some young bloke is in this supersonic jet fighter, and when it
goes to mach 3, suddenly the jet blows up, and all his clothes get ripped
off!!!! Then he mysteriously turns up in this room where he decides to have a
shave!!!!!!!!!!! Well, like me, you might be wondering about the logical basis
behind this advert, but one thing is sure- it'll soon be out of date!!!!!!!!!
That's because some clever people are working on a plane that is
capable supersonic flight at the speed of mach *<B>5</B>*!!!!!!!!!! Apparently
you'll be able to go from Tokyo to Los Angeles in 4 hours!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope
they'll have enough time to make a quick stop-off at our town tho!!!!!!!

Zone"</B>!!!!!!!!! (In fact, it has been said by some that I am worthy
cnadidate for such a zone- which I presume to be some sort of compliment, as
it certainly makes no sense to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Well, if the presenter Rod
Serling was a "soccer" player, he might have called it "Zone 14"
instead!!!!!!!! That's because apparently "Zone 14" is a really really
important place on the football field during a match!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Where it
is I do not know, but apparently that's where the final game of the last world
Cup was won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's porbably why some of the Brazilian team were
arguing with each other late in the match!!!!!! They were probably saying:
"We're not playing in Zone 14 enough, guys!!!!!!!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

shop with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, I don't normally do this myself, except of
course when our local supermarket manager decided to run a jokey "All shopping
is free if you bring your fridge with you!!!!!!!" type stunt for Red Nose
Day!!!! (I decided to lay on a van service for all the people at the Old
Folk's Home so that they could bring their fridges along!!!!!!!! The manager
wasn't too pleased!!!!!!!!! However, as I explained to the police afterwards,
the real trouble started when I suggested to the manager that perhaps he ought
to cheer up a bit and wear a red nose or something, after all it was Red Nose
Day, wasn't it!!!!!!!!!!!)
<P>
Ahem, anyway!!!!!!!!! If you've never taken the fridge to the shops, you might
do so in future, and the manager will actually be pleased as well!!!!!!!!
That's because you're not really taking the fridge to the shops, you're taking
the shops to your fridge!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Some bright sparks have come up with
this touch-screen thingy for fridges, called... (Check this original
name out!!!!!!!) "<B>Fridgescreen</B>", which apparently links to an online
shopping service!!!!!!!!! Only prob is- what happens if you put those funny
fridge magnets on the fridge?!?!?!? Won't it erase Fridgescreen's data or
something like that!??!?!?!

Well, don't worry, because there's one "person" whose had more "bangs" than
anyone else!!!!!!!!! I am of course talking about the Universe!!!!!!! You
might be thinking: "Wait a sec!!!!!!!!!! Didn't the universe only have one
really big bang at the start??!?!?!?" Well, er, technically, yes, but
according to new research, this universe is only one "bubble" that has been
created out of infinite universe "bubbles" each of which had their own big
bangs!!!!!!!!!!!!! So we're all the result of an infinite number of
bangs!!!!!!!! We wouldn't be too surprised if Mary Whitehouse starts
launching a crusade against astrophysics now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
