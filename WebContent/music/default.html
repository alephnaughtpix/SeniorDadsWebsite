Yes, c'est moi, <strong>Dame Vera Lynn</strong>, cranking out da wicked badboy chunes from the killer wheelz o' steel. Well, actually, it's with the benefit of those mighty soundtrakka programs <strong>Protracker</strong> and <strong>Xbios Music Maker</strong>, but that's my metaphorical wheelz o' steel on the Atari, so fuck dat shit forra laff!</p><h3>Enough of the bull, <span class="blink">daddio,</span> give us tha hardcore beatz!!</h3><p>Okey-dokey- hit it maestro!</p><ul class='musiclist'><li class='musicitem'><div class='title'><a name='fanfare'></a><a href="../filez/music/fanfare.zip">Senior Dads fanfare</a></div><div class='info'>At the start of every Dads demo- this was the version at the start of <a href="../demos/atuck.html">Anal Tuck</a>.

Well, of course they would, most beats-fortified farts hit the spot better than your shit-for-brains Beatle rip-offs, you top prize wankaah! So I made this killer chune completely outta burps!

This chune was added in our patch to Reject's demo. We did this tune in response to some guys in Poland called the RASERO TEAM, who thought they were being clever by doing a demo called 'Senior Fucks out'! You wot, mate?!? That demo was just shit, and the "music" didn't even get the bass frequencies right! Maybe you can't code to our level, guys, but at least you can get the chunes sorted! So that's what I did, just to show them who's boss. A cool jungle remix of a shite lamers tune, know what I'm sayin'?</div></li></ul><h3>Is that all, Mr Music Man?</h3><p>Quality, not quantity, that's my motto!</p><p>Peace.</p><p><strong><em>Dame VL</em></strong></p></body></html>
