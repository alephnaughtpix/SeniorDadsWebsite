<P>Having heard my amazing soundtracks to the Senior Dads killer demos,
you might be wondering <I>&quot;Yes, your choons are indeed well wicked
and amazing, but WTF are you gassing on about when you say <B>Phase 4 Stereo</B>?
Sort it out!&quot;</I> OK, then since you're all asking me, I'll fill you
in on all the details, but it'll take a bit to explain....</P>

<P>You see, I don't just do the coolest modules in the computer scene,
I also do DJ at the local student union! But don't turn up at the <B>Krusty</B> 
club at <B>Milton Central University</B>, and expect to see me behind
the wheels of steel pumping out tonz of hard badboy chunes, because I do
<B>Department S</B>, the easy listening night! I'll get round to doing
the hard stuff as well when I convince the dudes at the union that people
are crying out for a person of decent taste to show 'em the way to true
musical enlightenment.</P>
