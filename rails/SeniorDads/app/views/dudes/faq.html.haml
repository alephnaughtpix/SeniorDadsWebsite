            How the faq did you get started?
            .answer<>
              %p<>
                Well, the story of how we came to do our amazing first demo is <a href="../demos/atuck.html#Story">very well documented</a>, but it doesn't tell you how we first came together!!!
              %p<>
                Originally, when we were teenagers, I (<strong><a href="./dudes.html#Old_Fart">Old Fart</a></strong> !!!!) became friends with <strong><a href="./dudes.html#Doddering_git">Doddering Git</a></strong>. We both had Atari STs, and Doddering Git was really into the ST <strong><a href="http://www.fujiscene.home.ml.org">Demo scene</a></strong>, and was showing me all these really great demos like the Onion Demo by Delta Boys and Dark Side of the Inner Circle by The Lost Carebears!!! We thought <em>"Wouldn't it be great if we could do demoes like that?!?!? Yes!!!! Hey, let's try and make one of our own!!!!"</em>
              %p<>
                And even we were suprised at how good our demo was!!! So we sent it off to <strong>ST Floormat</strong> who were doing a feature on demos, and asked them what they thought of it!!! Unfortunately, they <a href="../demos/floormat.html#Story">ripped us off</a>, and it really disillousouned us!!!!
              %p<>
                Luckily we got back into demo coding once Atari brought out the <strong>Faclon</strong>, and we each got one!!!! We developed a couple of really kick-ass demo tricks which we later used in <strong><a href="../demos/atuck.html">Anal Tuck</a></strong> and <strong><a href="../demos/colonic.html">Colonic Irrigation</a></strong>. At this time,we got friendly with <strong><a href="dudes.html#Dame_Vera_Lynn">Dame Vera Lynn</a></strong>, who had been in a real-life demo crew before, and was trying to fit his ample musical talents into <strong>sound tracker modules</strong>!!!!
              %p<>
                We then went to the demo party <strong>Fried Place To Be 4</strong> in 1995, and at that party we decided to go for it, and make and release our first ever demo, <strong><a href="../demos/atuck.html">Anal Tuck</a></strong>!!! And it got quite a response!!!!
              %p<>
                Shortly after we released our second demo, we decided to do a website (ie this one!!!!)!! We needed help with the website GFX, so the Dame introduced us to <sd_member who="Jackson Pollock">, the guy who was the artist in the demo crew the Dame was in, before they were both chucked out because of <a href="../demos/teckno.html#Story">demo crew politics</a>!!!!
              %p<>
                His job on the initial 2 page SD website was so impressive, we asked him to join the crew!!! And he did!!!!!! And just before we released our amazing <strong><a href="../demos/airdirt.html">Air Dirt Demo</a></strong>, we met an Amiga coder called <strong><a href="dudes.html#Colostomy_Bag">Colostomy Bag</a></strong>, who was really amazed by our demos, and wanted to code demos like that on the Amiga!!!
              %p<>
                So that's how we came to be!!!
          .question<>
            %a(name="WhoNonceJessie")<>
            Who the faq are "Nonce" and "Jessie"?!??!
            .answer<>
              %p<>
                Ah, er!! These are the old names of the original two SD members!!
                %table#OldCrewList<>
                  %tr<>
                    %td.oldname<> Nonce
                    %td.equals<> =
                    %td.newname<> Old Fart
                  %tr<>
                    %td.oldname<> Jessie
                    %td.equals<> =
                    %td.newname<> Doddering Git
              %p<>
                The original names were of course an ironic politcal statement about sexual and gender role models within a corrupt Western society and stuff, but unfortunately some people didn't really understand that!!!! So we decided to change the names to something a bit more "neutral"!!! Only the <a href="../features/saggie/colonic.html">really early SD coverage and stuff</a> contains any references to "Nonce" and "Jessie", but if you see any of it, you know what's going on now!!!

              .answer<>
                %p<>
                  Some rather lazy commentators in the demo scene have said we do "fake" demos (ie joke ones!) and we're a fake demo crew!!!! However, most <strong>good</strong> commentators have noticed that there's a very noticeable difference between our demos and fake ones!! Ours are usually better!!!! And just to show those non-believers that there's a major difference between our demos and "fake" demos, we've done a <a href="../demos/fake.html"><strong>real</strong> fake demo</a>, to demonstrate the difference between it and our usual demos!!!
                %p<>
                  So we ain't no fake demo crew, we're the REAL <strong>SENIOR DADS</strong>!!!!!

                  They are crazy because they are representing a crazy world in uncompromising terms, but it's not really crazy- in fact it's completely sane, it's just that it's sanity is reflecting the craziness of the empty materialistic Western captalist system.

              %a(name="WhyEndWithCrash")<>
              Why the faq do SD demos end with a crash?!?!!
              .answer<>
                %p<>
                  Well, <strong>not</strong> all of them- in fact, <strong><a href="../demos/atuck.html">Anal Tuck</a></strong>, <strong><a href="../demos/ladmds2.html">L'Aube Du Matin Du Soir II (Remix)</a></strong>, <strong><a href="../demos/dadplazz.html">Dadplazz</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="../demos/fake.html">Ultimate Fake Demo</a></strong> don't end with a crash. OK, <strong>Dadplazz</strong> doesn't end at all, and you have to reset your machine to exit it, but strictly speaking that isn't a crash, so there!!!!! Anyway, for all the other demos, it's just that we're too good for the machine- as soon as machines get good enough, you'll be able to see those bits in their full intended glory!!!

            What the faq is the "Air demo"???!?
            .answer<>
              %p<>
                The <strong>Beach Boys</strong> have "<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(The_Beach_Boys_album)">Smile</a></strong>", we have "<strong>The Air Demo</strong>"!!!!
              %p<>
                The <strong>Air Demo</strong> is a demo we planned to release after <strong><a href="../demos/colonic.html">Colonic Irrigation</a></strong>. We'd done fire and water for our first two demos, so we decided to do air and earth for the next two, starting with the <strong>Air demo</strong>! At the time, we had got friendly with a crew called <strong>IPIR</strong>, and we were swapping tips and source and stuff. Then, while we were finishing the Air demo, IPIR released a demo at the NASA96 show with effects that looked very similar to our early Air demo effects!!!!
              %p<>
                We feared the worst,quickly cancelled the Air demo, and worked on a completely new demo which was to become the <strong><a href="../demos/airdirt.html">Air Dirt demo</a></strong>, and stopped talking to IPIR!!! In fact, when we released <strong>Air Dirt</strong> not long afterwards, we accused IPIR of ripping our code in the README!!!
              %p<>
                As it turned out, we were wrong- sorry IPIR!!! In fact, IPIR were just inspired by some of our demos, and coded their own versions!!!
              %p<>
                The <strong>Air demo</strong> remains unfinished, but if there's enough demand, and we have enough time, we might possibly finish it...
          .question<>
            %a(name="WhatIsJTSetc")<>
            What the faq is "JTS", "Hasbro", "Pacifist", etc. ?!?!?
            .answer<>
              %p<>
                Er, well, it really used to be simple!!!! It used to be that you could call our demos "<strong>Atari</strong>" demos, but in the past few years things hav got reely complex!!! First, Atari merged with an HD company called <strong>JTS</strong>, and were called "JTS Atari", and then the rights to the name were sold to makers of the <strong>Transformers</strong>, who are <strong>Hasbro</strong>!!! That's confusing enough, but there's also an Atari ST emulator for the PC called <strong><a href="../demos/pc.html">Pacifist</a></strong>, which can run some of our demos really well!!!! So it's anyone's guess now!!!! Basically all the above are words for the platform formerly known as <strong>Atari</strong>!!!!
          .question<>
            %a(name="WhyOnlyForAtari")<>
            Why the faq do you lot only do demos for the Atari platform?!?!?
            .answer<>
              %p<>
                Well, that's not really strictly true!!! We've done a <strong><a href="../java/scribble/default.html">Java drawing thingy</a></strong>!!! And some of our Atari demos work fine on the PC emulator <strong><a href="../demos/pc.html">Pacifist</a></strong>, so they're also PC demos as well!!! So there!!!
              %p<>
                Anyway, the reason is that we started out on the Atari platform, and we like it because it's really easy to program!! Also, it's really fashionable as well!!! Well, how many T-shirts do you see with the Microsoft logo on it in a hip 'n' trendy nightclub?!?!?!&nbsp; We think it's a really undervalued platform, and with our brilliant <a href="../demos/default.html">multimedia experiences</a>, we are making Atari great again!!!! Well, I think it's a good enough reason anyway!!!!!
              %p<>
                Actually, we are also wanting to spread some of our audiovisual magic to other platforms as well, but we haven't got round to it yet!!! For a start, this PC demo coding lark looks a bit complex!!! (But then, PC fans can see our <a href="../demos/pc.html">Atari ST demos</a> anyway!!) <strong>Colostomy Bag</strong> hasn't quite finished his Amiga stuff yet, but if you've seen the <strong><a href="demos/mono/mono.html">Monomental</a></strong> demo, then you know he's been active on the Atari side, and has coded the now-famous <strong>Kode-arokie</strong> effect!!&nbsp; Actually we quite like the ol' Miggy hardware, and can see a lot of possibilities with it!!! So watch out Amiga crews!!!!
          .question<>
            %a(name="AreYouOnlyFakeCrew")<>
            Are you bunch the only "faq" ("fake"!!!) demo crew?!?!?
            .answer<>
              %p<>
                Nope!!!!!!!!
              %p<>
                There are a few "fake" demo crews around on different platforms!!!! But of course, <a href="#AreSDTakingPiddle">as we explained above</a>, we're not really a fake demo crew anyway, but there are a few Atari fake crews around doing their stuff in the style of our completely non-fake art terrorism!!!!

                      These guys from France were around for quite some time before us!!! It was only a year into the life of the SD that we first saw any of their demos, because they weren't well spread beyond the French scene!!! In tribute to their far sighted genius, we remixed one of their megademos, and released it to the wider world as the <a href="../demos/ladmds2.html"><strong>L'Aube Du Matin Du Soir II (Remix)</strong></a>!!!!

                      These are the first guys we heard of, and they claim to be older than us!!! Nevertheless, their NASA96 demo was obviously influenced by the sort of things we were doing at the time!!!! They're pretty good guys from Sweden- thanks for forgiving us when we accused you of ripping our code off!!!

                      These guys are from Poland, and we first heard of them when they did a demo for the Orneta 97 party!!! They've recently released two demos called "<strong>Senior Rats</strong>" and "<strong>Senior Fucks Out</strong>"!!!! We've only seen the second of those two demos, but it seems pretty obvious that there's a bit of rivalry from Rasero Team!!! Why, we don't know!!!! But we responded by getting the <strong>Dame</strong> to do a chip music tune in their style called "<strong>Rasero Team Fuck Out!!</strong>"!!!!!

                      These guys are pretty new guys from the UK!!! They've recently released two small demos. One of them, called the <strong>Reject Demo</strong>, was pretty good but didn't have any music in it, so we patched the demo to add "<strong><a href="#RaseroTeam">Rasero Team</a> Fuck Out!!</strong>" to it!!!!

                      These are the main pretenders to our crown!!! They've slagged us off quite a few time in public and even private!!! But they are pretty decent as far as demos go!!! We quite liked their <strong>Ribbit</strong> demo!!! They're supposed to be from France or something.
