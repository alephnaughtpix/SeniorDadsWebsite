  %h1{ :align => "center" }<> Maggie's Dirk starts seeing things! 
  %h3.hightlight<> This wierd rumour comes from the <B>Dirk</B> column in <B>Maggie 23</B>. How can this guy not see &quot;Poom&quot;? Is he blind or something? I can see it fine! It's uses random principles to generate a fractal algorithm for the maze and textures, so it's different all the flippin' time!!

  %h2{ :align => "center" }<> Senior Dads fly!
  %p<> Just when you thought that the <B>Air Dirt</B> demo was a clever fake, it turns out that parts of it are cleverer than even we suspected.. 
  %p<> Now you might think the '<B>Poom</B>' clone, running in glorious 3-D stereogrammic vision, is just a bundle of dots with a wonky Abba sample, but you'd be wrong! <span class="highlight">[Of course, it's a 3D stereogram Doom clone with a brilliant Abba sample!! -Old Fart]</span>
  %p<> Although not a 3-D texturemapped,phong-shaded 'Doom' dungeon, you do get a short looped animation which consists of the legend 'Senior Dadzzz do it againnn! which zooms in and out.. There may be some sort of background as well, but I couldn't really tell.. 
  %p<> There are two ways of seing the animation, the one I personally recommend is to stand back eight or ten feet from the monitor screen, and squint really hard until the image starts to appear.. For people who really want to be sure, their best bet is to get really close to the monitor, and look at it from a forty-five degree angle, going in from the left hand side..
  %p<> Strictly one for Stereogram freaks, but an interesting 'hidden' part of the demo anyway.
