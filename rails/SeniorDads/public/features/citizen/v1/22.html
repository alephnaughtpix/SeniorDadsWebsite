<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Woops!!!!!!! Sorry for that break in publication last week, but I
was really busy on this presentation thingy!!!!!! You see, I got an
interview for some job thingy at a university place, and it was for
some job about learning using computers or some such lark!!!!!!!! So
I had to do a presentation about learning on the Internet, and I
spent a long time working on it!!!!!!!! Unfortunately, I think I came
across as a little too forceful!!!!! After all there's only so many
times you can say "Shut up and stop talking, you idiots!!!!" isn't there?!?!?
<P>
Anyway, I've also been working hard on my brilliant editing suite for
this publication, and I've now got the first version working!!!! And this is is the first issue edited on it!!!!!!!!! So,
there should be less spelling mistakes from now on, as I can edit the stories in the databse a little easier now!!!! Even
more interesting is that very soon, we'll have done 666 stories!!!!!!
So hopefully we won't be taken over by the Devil before the next
issue!!!!!!!!!!</FONT>

          if the Diamond Rio is going to have any competition in the MP3 player 
          market... To this we can only say: "Yepp!!!!!!!!" That's because *<B>Yepp</B>* 
          is the name of a new range of MP3 players by big Korean dudes, Samsung, 
          which was shown off this week at the International CES held in Las Vegas!!!! 
          What's really interesting about it is that in amongst the range is the 
          first ever consumer MP3 *<B>recorder</B>* we've seen!!!!!! Shame Elvis 
          isn't still around, or they could have have got him to sing "Viva Las 
          Vegas" into it, and it could be released as an MP3 on tha netweb!!!!!!!! 
          That would certainly be good promotion, wouldn't it!!!!!!!!! It's just 
          a shame Elvis kicked the bucket over 20 years ago!!!!!!!! Bet Samsung 
          are kicking themselves!!!!!!!!

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, these guys 
          certainly know how to "Fight the Power"!!!!! Only a month or two after 
          they posted their entire "Bring the Noise 2000" album online in MP3 
          format just to annoy their record company, and then took it off after 
          their record company got annoyed enough to get heavy with the lawyer 
          people, they've now posted a new song, "Swindlers Lust"- in *<B>MP4</B>* 
          format!!!!!!!!!!! 
          <P> <a href="http://www.public-enemy.com/mp4/swinlust.html">http://www.public-enemy.com/mp4/swinlust.html</a> 
          <P> But what's MP4!?!?! Is it the latest form of MPEG file?!?!?! In 
            fact, no it isn't!!!!! It's just some company's proprietary format 
            which they just happen to call "MP4", which by an odd coincidence 
            just happens to sound exactly like what you would expect to call an 
            MPEG-1 Layer 4 file, or an MPEG-4 file!!!!! 
          <P> <a href="http://www.mp3.com/news/156.html">http://www.mp3.com/news/156.html</a> 
          <P> But that's not all!!!!!!!!!! A lot of people on Slashdot have noticed 
            that PE's tune only available as Windows only executable file and 
            are kicking up a bit of a fuss about it!!!!!!!! The executable apparently 
            includes a player, but it's ironic that PE are slagging off commercialism 
            in such a prinicipled fashion, whilst supporting the world's biggest 
            software company and using a proprietary format!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
          <P> <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/11/0847217.shtml">http://www.slashdot.org/articles/99/01/11/0847217.shtml</a> 
          <P> But the player wasn't the only executable!!!!!!!! At the time of 
            writing (11/1/99), the website posted this warning: 
          <UL>
            <I>If you downloaded Swindler's Lust MP4 today (1/7) between 3 p.m.and 
            5:15 p.m. EST, it may be infected with a virus. A new copy has been 
            uploaded. P.E. apologizes for the oversight.</I> 
          </UL>
          <P> Woops!!!!!! Luckily, some compiled an MP3 version of the file!!!!!!!! 
            And the Public Enemy website people have also put it on their website, 
            which now means PE are now supporting a cross-platform non-proprietary 
            format!!!!!!! So it's ended up all right in the end anyway!!!!!!!

          ask me!!!!!!!! 
          <P> Mind you, some of these people seem to be as dim as a post, and 
            as subtle as a Michael Winner movie!!! One person who calls himself 
            "Lou Cipher" says: <I>"We have actually gotten on a plane and visited

            and steal their computers!!!!! If anything goes wrong and we get caught, 
            we'll just explain to the Norwegian authorities that it was all Louie

            resort to baseball bats. That's what these punks will understand. 
            Then word gets around, and we're left alone. That's all we want, to 
            be left alone."</I> Which of course explains why all the loners we 
            know of carry baseball bats, doesn't it?!?!??!! Some of you older 
            readers might remember that this story sounds oddly familiar- in fact 
            we covered a similar online-inspired baseball bat showdown in our 
            very first issue!!!!! (See <a href="1.html#4"> issue 1</A>...) OK, 
            it wasn't about hacking, but then again, everyone knows that all hackers 
            deserve to get beaten around the head with baseball bats, don't they?!?! 
            Mind you, it wouldn't be so good for the computer security industry, 
            which is stuffed with ex-hackers, and is, oddly enough, Lou Cipher's

          about the famous Disney cartoon character!!!!!! They're actually talking 
          about a flying piece of rock that was named after the dog by an American 
          astronomer called Clyde Tombaugh!!!!! (Who ironically, was himself named 
          after a famous paddle steamer on the River Clyde which went to the Mull 
          of Kintyre, which is where Paul McCartney got the idea for his song!!!!!!!! 
          So if you ever wanted to know what the connection is between Paul McCartney 
          and a piece of flying rock millions of miles away, now you know!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
          Erm, anyway!!!! When it was discovered, it was thought Pluto was the 
          ninth planet in the Solar System, but it looked a bit small for a planet!!!!!!! 
          Then, astronomers found an area not so far way called the "<B>Kuiper 
          Belt</B>", (Named of course after Agent Cooper in "Twin Peaks"!!!!) 
          which has around 60 Pluto-sized asteroids!!!!! So it looks as though 
          Pluto is really just a big asteroid originating from that area, and 
          is not really a planet at all!!!!! (Which astronomers always expected 
          to be a bit more massive than Pluto appeared to be- because of gravity 
          or something really smart like that!!!!!)

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, they say 
          there are zillions of ways to waste your time on the Internet!!!! (Actually, 
          they don't say that!!!!! I just made it up!!!!!! So it was a bit of 
          waste of your time reading that, wasn't it?!?!?! Which of course, was 
          exactly my point in the first place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
          <P> Anyway, here's one way in which people waste their time!!!!!!! This 
            is a website called "<B>Disgustocollective</B>"- which is against 
            the Internet!!!!!!!!!!!!! We really like the bit where they say <I>"optimal 
            @ 600X800 resolution"!!!!!!!!</I>

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You know those 
          adverts from EA Sports for their football games, where you get some 
          cockney person going "Whahey!!! I'm mad about football me!!! etc", and 
          then they have some American voice saying "EASports!!!It'sInTheGame!!!!" 
          very quickly!!!!!! Well, you might ask, what is in the game!?!?!?! Well, 
          in this case, it's the pilot episode of that popular TV show "<B>South 
          Park</B>"!!!!!!!! Yep, someone decided to put a copy of the original 
          South Park story "<B>The Spirit of Christmas</B>" on the CD-Rom of one 
          of EA's games without telling anyone!!!!!!! If you've got the early 
          Playstation version of "<B>Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour</B>" then load the 
          CD-Rom into your PC, and see if you can find it!!!!!!!!!! Just don't 
          show it me, that's all!!!!!!

          some money from Microsoft- for a 'publicity stunt'!!!!!!!!</font></a> 
        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You now, sometimes 
          news is like a snowball!!!!!!! An obvious example of this happened this 
          week, when someone put up a web page of his experiences in trying to 
          get money from Microsoft!!!!! He'd bought a little PC computer, and 
          they had pre-loaded Windows on it... But he didn't want the PC for Windows, 
          as he was going to put Linux on it!!!!!!!!! So he asked for a refund 
          on the software!!!!! Apparently that microscopic text with that licence 
          thingy you get with Windows says that you can get a refund!!!!!!!! He 
          had a bit of trouble actually getting the money from them tho!!!!! But 
          when he eventually got it, he detailed all his experiences on a webpage 
          for all to read!!!!!

          <P> Then someone told Slashdot about it!!!!!!!! And there was a lot 
            of discussion!!!!!!!!

          <P> The resulting publicity inspired this interesting little website 
            which is organising a mass "refund" day!!!!!!!!

          nothing like forward planning!!!!!!!!!! And some dude called <B>Steven

          He's designing a superduper fabby-dabby spaceship- and it'll only be 
          completed (If ever!!!!) a very long time from now, when you're dead!!!!!!!! 
          And the mission is so long that when it's finished, the people who will 
          first pilot the ship will be dead as well!!!!!!!! Apparently it's a 
          "generational" spaceship or something.

          these jolly little stories about people spying on each other in the

          for plants!!!!!!!</font></a> 
        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When you're wanting 
          to protect the plants in your garden against the harsh temperatures 
          of winter, what do you do?!?!?! Well, you might spray your plants with 
          anti-freeze like I do!!!!!!! Unfortunately you might find that the disadavantages 
          (Most of your plants drop dead!!!!!) outweigh the advantages!!!!! (Your 
          home-made tomato juice tastes very much like Austrian red wine!!!!!) 
          Well, it appears in future, we won't need to worry about that!!!!! We'll 
          just need to put jeans on the plants!!!! Well... Not really, but can 
          put special *<B>genes</B>* on them!!!!!!!!! Some really clever scientests 
          have found the gene which prevents plants freezing!!!!!! Which is really 
          interesting, because if I run out of antifreeze when I'm trying to get 
          my Robin Reliant defrosted, I can grow these special plants, and rub 
          them on the car instead!!!!!!!
