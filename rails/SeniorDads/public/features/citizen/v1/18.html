the Grelb addr or <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org/">http://seniordads.atari.org/</a> , and we hope to have another
snappy redirect addr soon!!!!
<P>
Second!!!! I'm wanting your views on what's the best stories of the year!!!! If you've
got an opinion, send it to us at <a href="mailto://senior@forfree.at">mailto://senior@forfree.at</a> ... Or better still,
if you're a member of the mailing list, why not send your suggestions to the list,
and let's have a discussion?!?!?! So when you've finished this brilliant issue, why
not have a look at the previous equally brilliant issues and suggest your fave
stories?!?!?!

          we had a good laugh at those silly Americans for seeing sinister motivations 
          behind the Teletubbies?!?!?! (See <a href="14.html#409"> issue 14</A>...) 
          I made some flip comment about UK viewers seeing similar motives in 
          Barney the Dinosaur!!!!!! Well, guess what I saw in an issue of the 
          Scotsman today (24/11/98)!??! Apparently, quite a few parents don't 
          like Barney, and think it's an unsuitable role model for the kids!!!!! 
          And the article mentions a lot about all the anti-Barney resources on 
          tha netweb!!!!! 
          <P>
Now, you would have thought that this article would have therefore been
an obvious candidate for the Scotsman's online web edition, but no!!!!
And there's not a trace of the story in <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/">http://www.scotsman.com/</a> !!!!
There isn't even a mention of it in the Scotsman's Yahoo News section in
<a href="http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/scotsman/">http://www.yahoo.co.uk/headlines/scotsman/</a> !!!!! Talk about missing the point!!!

(And, yes, that's partly why the previous ish was a bit late!!!!) One of
the things in the Union was this converted bar, which played "cheesy disco"
all the time, so you had all these young whippersnappers with oblong-shaped
"media" glasses dancing around really rather badly with "ironic" grins to
tunes that are as old as the hills!!!!!!! What a brilliant and completely
original idea!!!! OK, perhaps showing "South Park" on the video wall was
perhaps taking things a bit too far, and I definately showed them up in
the dancing stakes when Tight Fit's "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" came on!!!!
But apart from that, it was really "ironic" and "postmodern"!!!!!!!!!!!
<P>
So I was pleased to hear of this rather fabby idea!!!!!!! An Internet Radio
show devoted to cheesy disco!!!!!! OK, the website looks a little like a
Realaudio-encoded Sinclair Spectrum display, but it's a great idea for a netweb
siteweb!!!! You'll need to start wearing rectangular-shaped glasses, and grow
a goatee beard before listening to it tho!!!!!

that you can register your own free account with them, and have your own

mega-playlist!!! You can choose general genres from the various radio
stations, but you can also go down to a more detailed level, and select/deselect
individual artists in your personal playlists!!!!! Even better, you can make

The Realaudio soundquality is pretty AM-like, but you actually get all of the

and download the latest webpages from your favourite "channels", and you can read them
offline!!! So you could, for example, get all the news from your favourite daily
news websites automatically, and make up your own customised offline internet
"newspaper"!!!! Unfortunately, despite some good push stuff, and even some hype from
Micosoft, with their "Active Channels" stuff in IE, there were loads of competing
proprietary standards, and the "best thing since slice bread" style hype didn't exactly
do any favours either!!!!

          they've done it!!!!! Well, almost!!!!! Users can create their own Zing! 
          channel with JPEGs and/or Shockwave Flash anims either form the web, 
          or their own HD!!!!! 
          <P>
Only one prob- unlike Pointcast's user channels, which allows users to put their
channels on tha w3 for other users to download into the viewer, and always checks
for updated content or channel data on the net, the Zing! channel only remains on
the users HD as a part of some config textfile!!! If we wanted to broadcast our
own Senior Dads Zing! channel, we'd have to take the bit of the config file with
our stuff on it, and tell viewers to cut and paste it into their own config
file!!!!! Not very user-friendly, eh?!?!?! And there's no way to telling the
channel to update, short of telling the user to select "Update now" from the menu
every so often!!!!
<P>
So, it'll take a bit more updating in program terms before Zing! really becomes
a hit, we think!!! But they're moving in the right direction!!!!

computers by now, so here's a new one for you!!!! <B>Trinux</B> is like Linux- only
smaller!!!! It fits on 3 flopy disks, and says in RAM all the time, just like an old
Amiga 500 system!!!! Apparently this is really handy for portable systems or something
like that!!!!

          short time later, stopped working altogether, has now suddenly started

this is a really clever idea!!!!! The space agency dudes are seriously considering

Yes, I'm of course, referring to Ronald Reagan!!!!! One of his great ideas at the
time was this thingy called "Star Wars", which apparently had nothing at all to
do with the film, but was about zapping satellites and missile with big laser
guns and stuff!!!!! A lot of people for some reason found this idea extremely
funny!!!!! But the really funny thing is that according to this story, by the
time the next "Star Wars" comes out, the Chinese might have a laser weapon to zap
out satellites!!!!!

          We've managed to get listed in their directory, despite us questioning

can, erm, "do" a 3D image!!!!! This one's a bit different tho- it uses a
funny flash using lights of different frequencies, and measures the different
frequencies and works out from that how to "do" a 3D piccy!!!!!

that they really liked Culture Club and A Flock of Seagulls all along, it
obviously won't be too long before the early 90s are back in fashion!!!!!! So
why not get their before anyone else by visiting this site, which is all about
one of the classic early 90s fashion statements- the fractal thingy!!!! Yes,
with "<B>Sprott's Fractal Gallery</B>", you can remember the times when all those
"Mandlebrots" and "Julias" were staring out from the cover of zillions of
"Ambient House" compilations!!!! In fact, you can even re-create the sound as
well, because the website also features random "fractal" MIDI music on the
pages!!! Now, all that's left is for the webmaster to call himself "Juan" or
something.
