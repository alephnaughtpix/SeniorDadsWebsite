We've made to issue 10!!!!!! A bit late because we were at the <B>Reservoir
Cwmvention 1998</B> last week, but here it is!!!<P>
Another piece of good news!!!! You notice that little "webring" thingy on
the left column of the webpage!!!!! Yes, that's right!!!!! We're on an ezine
webring!!!! OK, you've probably been noticing it for the past couple of weeks,
but it didn't quite work properly because we weren't actually accepted into
it yet!!!! But now we're finally on the <B>E-zine Webring</B>, after a wait
of about 3 weeks!!!! We were wondering why it was taking so long- then we
realised that we forgot to send an email to the admin of the webring!!!!!!
But that's fixed now!!!!<P> One ultra-annoying thing tho- in the past couple
of weeks, the Coollist mailing list server which SC transmits it's email
versh on has gone into meltdown!!! It's probably due to that "Clinton"
business being discussed on a couple of mailing lists, but when Coollist
finally resurrected itself earlier this week, it had imposed a 20K limit on
messages, which means I'll probably need to split the email versh into two
parts!!!! Bah!!!!!!

BTW we've just found out that Negativland is actually named after some track
by one of those "alternative" German groups from the early 70s!!!! Why they
didn't name themselves after a more snappily-titled track like "Morgenspaziergang"
we don't know!!!!!!!!

putting sensitive data on a publicly available website might not be a good
idea!!!! And they're doing a search on their websites to check there's no
secret stuff!!! "Loose lips sink ships" they say!!!! Well, of course loose
lips sink ships- if they keep dribbling on long enough, it'll waterlog the
ship and it'll sink!!!! But I don't see what that's got to do with the
websites!!!!!!!!!!

those Children's ITV progs from the 80s with Gaz Top on it, but it's actually
a strange program which loads visuals and stuff while you're on the Internet,
but not actually downloaing anything, and then when you click on a webpage,
you get a bit of these visuals appearing whilst you're waiting for the page
to download!!!! It's actually a pretty decent idea, but we think the content
will have to get better before it really catches on!!!! There are numerous
"channels" which "broadcast" about 15 secs of Shockwave Flash animation, one
of them is a "famous quotes" chan, another is a "Learn French" spot, and then
there's one devoted to music "clips" from various bands reviewed in a US
magazine called "Rolling Stone", who appear to be devoted to exactly the same
sort of bands covered in that book I did last year called <I>"First Against
