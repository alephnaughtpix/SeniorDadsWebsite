Now you might call me paranoid, but... Don't you think the timing of this
attack on Iraq, at the same time as the impeachment hearings, is a bit of a
coincidence!??!?!?!?! Now I don't wish to be scaremongering or anything, but
I think President Clinton started the attack to divert attention from the
impeachment hearings!!!!!!!!!!!
<P>After the mailing list delayed the last issue by a couple of days, I
thought it might be a neat idea to make up my own mailer proggy!!!! I'm
currently writing the flippin' thing, and I'll be testing it soon...
<P>
Anyway, Merry Christmas to you lot, and all that jazz!!!! Have a nice time,
and make sure you watch the "Davey" Bond movie!!!!!!!!!!!!

          (Or "bum", as you Americans say- hence the hilarious movie title: "Halleluia,

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Kvetch!!!!!!!!! 
          Don't worry, I'm not sneezing there!!!!!!!!! In fact, I'm informing 
          you of an interesting idea on tha netweb with really great potential!!!! 
          OK, I don't know what "kvetch" actually means, but it's the name of 
          a website, where you can view short and sharp little rants on various 
          subjects by various people... And about 30 seconds later, the site randomly 
          loads another one!!!! You can of course add your own rant to the mix, 
          and annoy loads of other people with your superior intillect!!!!! 
          <P> Now if that was it, it would be just a vaguely interesting site, 
            but wait- there's more!!!! That zappy <B>Zing!</B> crowd have teamed 
            up with Kvetch, and have started putting Kvetch "comments" on Zing!!! 
            So you can put some comment into the Kvetch, and then some time later 
            you might be surfing the web- and your Kvetch comment suddenly appears 
            in Zing whilst you're surfing!!!! 
          <P> Now it doesn't take a genius to work out that you could use this 
            idea for something like an Internet noticeboard for not-too-urgent 
            messages- stick the message and a contact addr into the website, and 
            the messages are converted for Zing! or whatever, so that it can download 
            them, and then while you're surfing, you can see the messages, and 
            reply to them!!!!! 
          <P> Neat idea, huh?!?! So if you're thinking of it, Zing! peeps, please 
            credit us for it!!!!!

          around with that new Lego robot set on Xmas morning, but what you might 
          not know is that you might be doing the same thing as NASA on their 
          next Mars missions!!!!!! The "space dudes" are going to be using robots 
          to 'follow the water' on their next missions!!!!! Er, except of course, 
          that they're not using Lego, at least not last time I looked!!!!! Now 
          you might think that using a robot to 'follow the water' is a bit stupid 
          as the water will "fuse" it's "positronic brain" and put into a "logical 
          failure" or something like that... Well, this robot is a little different!!!! 
          Apparently this one has "eyes" and "ears"!!!!!! So it'll probably be 
          also wearing a nice waterproof macintosh jacket as well!!!

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yes, you can't 
          beat 'java/coffee' jokes, can you!??!?! :) :-) :-P Erm, anyway!!!! There 
          was all that talk a couple of years ago about how Java was designed 
          to work in microwaves, telephones, toenail clippers, etc.. , but that 
          quietened down a bit... Until now!!!!!! Sun, the company wot makes Java, 
          has got together with Matsui, who make radiograms, amongst other things!!!!!! 
          <P> They're supposed to be working on consumer devices with Java proggys 
            in them!!! Which is really good, because it means in future, if I 
            want to switch on my telly, I just fire up Andrew Ridgley (The name 
            of my Wintel box!!! It used to be called James Dean- until someone 
            pointed out that James Dean only crashed once!!!!!!), log onto tha 
            NetWeb, and access my telly through tha megamighty W3, and tell it 
            to switch on!!!!!!

          leave the outside still standing!!!

                  <pre>"Top Ten reasons the PlayStation Underground Radio Network
 is better than radio:
<P>
 10. You can listen to it AND watch it.
  9. You can do # 10 while at the office and you'll actually look
     like you're working.
  8. Interviews you won't find anywhere else from the people who
     make your favorite PlayStation games.
  7. Hot, fresh codes hand delivered 24 hours a day for no extra
     charge.
  6. Short attention span? Mind wanders? No worries. You can go
     back and listen to what you missed again. And again. And
     again.
  5. No strange static when you drive under bridges.
  4. Your friends will NEVER come to your house just to listen
     to the radio.
  3. No Emergency Broadcast Service tests--ever.
  2. David Lawrence is your host, and if you can handle it, the
     guys from videogames.com are there to tell you first hand
     what it's all about.
  1. You'll never have to sit through a crummy pop song to find
     out what cool thing is coming up next." </PRE>
