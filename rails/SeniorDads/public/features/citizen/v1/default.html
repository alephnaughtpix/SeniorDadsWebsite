        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, you might 
          have vaguely remembered that little privacy argument over Pentium IIs 
          and their serial numbers!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="23.html#676"> issue 
          23</A>...) Intel said it could be switched "off" by one of their clever 
          programs, but as the number is still there, it would only take someone 
          to work out how to switch it back "on" again!!!!!!!! And that "person" 
          is the old German computer mag, <B>C'T'</B>!!!!!!!! They've now proved 
          that even with the number switched "off", software can still switch 
          it back on and read it!!!!!!!!!!!! 
          <P>
Intel are now doing a "fix", wherw the BIOS makes sure the number
is kept "off", but firstly that only works at bootup, so some company
could still read your serial no. in the meantime!!!!!! And what's
more, your BIOS can also be re-programmed to not switch the number
off!!!!!!!!!!!!!

a powered "zike" which has infinite energy!!!!!!!!!!!!! You just need these
people in the following article to slow down the apparent speed of light for
you!!!!!!!!!!
<P>
Well, actually, they of course do not actually slow down the speed of light,
as that's always at the.. erm, speed of light!!!!!!!! They actually stick the
light through a cloud of atoms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the effect of sticking
loadsa atoms in the way slows down the transmission of light to a puny 17 metres
a second!!!!!!!!! Why not just stick a brick wall in front of the light beams-
that would slow it down to zero metres per second, wouldn't it?!?!?!?!?!?

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Have you ever 
          been surfing on tha NetWeb, and thought: <I>"Hmmm... It's a shame I 
          don't have a Wurlitzer with me!!!!!!!!!!!!!"?!?!?!</I> Well, now someone 
          has solved that somewhat awkward predicament!!!!!!!!! If you've got 
          a speedy gonzales netweb connection and the latest version of Winamp, 
          that is!!!!!!!! Yes, that's right, it's one of those delightful <B>Shoutcast</B> 
          broadcasting sites, (See <a href="21.html#614"> issue 21</A>...) and 
          this one's a jukebox style one!!!!!!!! This one allows one to browse 
          through a list of tunes, and select from them which ones you want to 
          be queued on the server next!!!!!!!!! And there's actually quite a good 
          choice!!!!!!!!! Despite the really dreary choice that passes for "random" 
          choices when no-one's requesting anything, (You would probably like 
          it if you read that "Rolling Stone" magazine a lot!!!!) there's actually 
          a slightly better choice than you get in most pub jukeboxes!!!! So when 
          we found about this really neat site, the first thing we did we did 
          was to stop all the Counting Crows and similar nonsense and queue up 
          some good old Aqua and Duran Duran, which must have been a bit disconcerting 
          to the other two listeners at the time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
          <P>
It's probably a bit dodgy on the legal front to say the least, what with all those
copyright files being streamed outwards, but we like the
idea, and can imagine a legit equivalent of it going down
really well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So you might as well get along to it before
someone goes el-stamp-o on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the MOD, who finally bothered to comment on the story on 3rd March after

Well, that might not be worth reporting, you'd think!!!!!!!!!!! After all, the
MOD would probably say it's a load of cobblers, wouldn't they, even if it
wasn't!!!!!!!!!! But some people at a US mag on tha NetWeb, noticing the lack
of UK investigation, decided to conduct their own!!!!!!!!!!! And they found
out it was a load of cobblers as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But it's not really well
