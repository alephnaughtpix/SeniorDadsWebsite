So.... Your group's been deleted, huh?
Well, let's discuss...
1. It was full of crap
2. There are other digitiser ng's about
3. It was badly named
4. It wasn't discussed in alt.config, so this kind of response would be
inevitable
5. Blah blah
I think somebody (maybe me) should make a proposal for a *proper* digi
group. With a proposal, charter, and everything. A fresh start, if you will.
Meanwhile, take a seat in alt.games.video.digitiser or some such group. And
yes, it was a regular who was fed up with all the crap in the group who
posted the rmgroup message (it won't be too hard to find out who it was). Do
not be nasty... There is hope for you!
Actually, I wasn't expecting the control message to work anyway ;) - but it
did.
Since Stuart Campbell made a bit of a goof up with his attempts to create a
digi group in the uk. hierachy, it may not be possible to create one there
(although it's worth a try)... Failing that, maybe it should belong in
alt.uk. Well, see you 'round.
If a proper proposal is going to be made, anyone care to help me out?
