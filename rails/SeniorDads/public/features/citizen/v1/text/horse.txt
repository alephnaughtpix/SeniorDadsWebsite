I've just seen there's a film called "The Horse Whisperer"!!!!

What a bizarre name!!!!!!

That's about as strange as:
* The Pig Bagpiper!!!
* The Cow Fiddler!!!
* The Sheep Trumpeter!!!
* The Rhinocerous Percussionist!!
* The Man Who Played Digeridoo to Dogs!!!
* The Whispering Male Equivalent of Barbera Woodhouse- for Horses!!!

Erm, I'm out of ideas!!

Old Fart!
