You might have also noticed that we've got another name as well as the <a href="http://seniordads.home.ml.org">http://seniordads.home.ml.org</a> one!!!!!
In fact, we've had the <a href="http://seniordads.atari.org">http://seniordads.atari.org</a> name for a couple of months now, but we haven't used as
much because originally it wasn't able to handle additional directories appended to the
name... But now it can!!!!!! And as the dude from DHS said on IRC, it's less likely to
be down than the home.ml.org address, so if the home.ml.org addr doesn't work, try
replacing it with "atari.org"!!!!!!

          format!!!!!!! GoodNoise, MP3.com, MusicMatch, and Xing Technology, and 
          Diamond Multimedia are the dudes together and say: "Three cheers for 
          MP3!!!!!!!!!" Oddly enough, one of them, Diamond Multimedia, are the

various new technologies and what they mean to the transmission

Meanwhile, the various possibilities of the net for music
distribution have been espoused by none other than Todd Rungren,
the producer of "Bat Out of Hell" and records by Grand Funk
Railroad!!!!!!! I suppose when he releases his record on the net,
then it'll be downloaded quicker than a Bat Out of Hell!!!!!!

longer articles into seperate pages, like their old articles in

there's loads of them, and each of them are good in their own way!!!!! So wouldn't it
be really great if they were all combined!?!?!? Well, there are a couple of websites
that do this!!!!!! The best one we've seen around is given the really funky name of
"<B>DogPile</B>", which is really cool, because it goes around a "pile" of search engines
like a very eager "dog" to get it's results!!!!!
<P>
<a href="http://www.dogpile.com/">http://www.dogpile.com/</a>

Now there's even personal search engine programs, which also compile results from zillionz
of searchies!!!!! At this point however, a couple of the "big names" in search engines are
starting to get a little cheesed off with people using their sites like this, and are attempting
to find ways to thwart these proggies!!! But it's going to be very hard, I think!!!!!!!!!!

However, they're not the only Quake clone around in Java!!!!! The old Atari demo crew, the
Carebears have done a little game called "<B>Frag Island</B>" completely in Java, with no
machine-code bits!!!!!!! If you have a reasonably fast computer and Netscape/IE 4, then this
is a rather neat-o little game!!!!!! Only prob is- as with a lot of Java games- it takes
bloody ages to load!!!!!!!

to Edward G Wood, director of such classics as "Plan 9 From Outer Space", and that one
with the plastic surgeon who does operations on a sofa, using such clinical precautions as
bowls of hot water and towels!!!!!!!! One of the really good bits is a detailed list of
continuity bloopers for "Plan 9...", so you can shout along with it, like it was the "Rocky

OK, get this- what they planned was... putting little cactus thorns with HIV and rabies on
them into a cigarette lighter, so that when you light something with it, you get zapped by
the thorns!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, that's a bit stupid, isn't it?!??!?!?!?! I mean, what do they
expect to happen?!?!?! Do they expect the President to be a heavy smoker, and then he goes
to their neck of the woods, and then ask them if they have a light, and then they go:
"Sure!!!! Just try this lighter here!!!!! (Huh huh huh!!!!)", and give him the lighter
with the thorns in it, then he uses it, and get zilched, and goes "Argh!" and
dies?!?!?!?!??!?!?!
<P>
Somehow I think this is a little unlikely!!!!!!!!!!!!

someone going on about Scotland excelling in something really insignificant!!!!!!!! In short,
anyone who makes Scots look like a bunch of prats, you'll see it first in the Daily Record!!!!!

"I can't believe that ABC has done this!" declared a horrified
senior staffer in Matt Fong's senate campaign office late Monday
night.
<P>
"Do they really hate republicans that much that they would fake the
results and put them on their website! They should be sued by
everyone they already show losing!"
<P>
The charges are explosive!
<P>
It is not clear what ABC NEWS hoped to achieve by releasing
"Election Results" on the Internet a day before the election.
<P>
One ABC NEWS source in Washington, who demanded anonymity, was
completely floored when showed the website returns:

"This looks very serious. I'm calling [ABC NEWS President David]
Westin."

intelligence, apparently "neural networks" are the thing to be trying!!!!!!!!! And apparently
they work better if you do it on an *<B>analogue</B>* computer!!!!!! So digital technology
by comparision is stupid!!!!!!!!!!!! What's interesting is that the bods here say that
neural technology based on analogue computer can finally allow the implementation of a really
old machine technique invented by that Alan Turing person, back in the days of black and white
TV!!!!!!!

Dean, on account of it crashing a lot!!!! As opposed to Godzilla, the machine which actually
compiles each issue of this esteemed publication!!!!!!!) I find this rather interesting!!!!
Adaptec & Liquid Audio have teamed up for yet another "music on demand" scheme, but this one
is different, because it's aimed at people who have CD recorders!!! What happens is that you
go to this lot's webpage, and download the proggy- this proggy then can allow you to download
music for a small fee, and burn it onto a CD using your own recorder!!!!!!!!! Of course, you
could always make up your own chunes and burn them into your own CD etc., ...

Hedy Lammar!!!!!!!!! No, she wasn't Mark Lammar's mum, she was someone
completely different, and anyway, she was a talented film actress!!!
Erm, anyway!!!!! She's suing Corel softwarebecause they put a likeness of
her on the cover of Corel Draw 8, without her permission!!!! A lot of
people are surprised to how "aggressive" Corel are at defending
themselves!!!!! What they might forget is that Hedy Lammar also sued Mel
Gibson after he did that character called *<B>Hedly</B>* Lammar in the film
"Blazing Saddles"!!!!!! So they're probably just getting back at her
because she's such an obvious spoilsport!!!!!

According to this website, you can buy quantities of the highly

sounds a little expensive, remember that a milligram of it is enough to cause cancer!!!!
So if you have a business competitor or someone else you want to get rid of, it doesn't
sound that much does it?!?!?!?!?!? And remember, as this website says: <I>"Quantity
discounts may be available. Call for current discounted price"</I>!!!!!!!!!

I wonder what would happen if a load of people call in pretendening to be "Mr Hussein"
