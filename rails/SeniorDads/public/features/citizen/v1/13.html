          for MP3 (Sound)!!!!!</font></a>
        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember that 
          classic landmark popular music videogram from the 1980s by Cliff Richard 
          called "Wired For Sound"??!?!?! For all you young people, it was a jolly 
          little song about listening to one's walkman!!! And the video was full 
          of really "hip" people on roller-skates listening to their walkmans!!! 
          Because listening to walkmans were really hip in the 1980s!!!! Well, 
          I wonder how the 90s equivalent of Cliff Richard (eg that young man 
          out of popular beat group Oasis- at least he can sing, eh Chris Evans?!?!) 
          would approach the 90s equivalent here!!!!! Some combo called Saehan 
          Information systems have done a walkman- for MP3 files!!!!!! You can 
          upload loadsa MP3 files from your compute to this thingy, and you have 
          a portable MP3 walkman, and you can put on your roller skates and look 
          really hip like in the 80s!!!!!! I can imagine the sort of songs Noddy 
          Gallagher from Oasis is probably thinking up like: <I>"Shaker MP3er", 
          "Do you know what I MP3?" "You Gotta Roll with MP3", "Don't MP3 Back 
          In Anger",</I> and Erm...!! I've run out of ideas!!!!! 
          <P> <a href="http://www.mpman.com">http://www.mpman.com</a> 
          <P> If you're a Unix person, you can use this proggy to upload your 
            files to the thingy.... 
          <P> <a href="http://www.world.co.uk/sba">http://www.world.co.uk/sba</a> 
          <P> But they'd better be quick, because <B>Samsung</B> is on the case!!!!! 
            According to this story from the Korean Times, Samsung, are bringing 
            out their own MP3 player!!! When a name like Samsung enters the market, 
            they must be taking it seriously!!!! 
          <P> <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/14_5/9810/t455166.htm">http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/14_5/9810/t455166.htm</a> 
          <P> Samsung might run into a bit of a legal clash with the American 
            record company moguls, who have already managed to delay one MP3 walkman. 
            But check this one out!!!! A UK company is planning to release an 
            MP3 player, which is actually a little PC running Linux!!!!! Because 
            it's a PC, it might skirt round the legal probs!!!! And since it's 
            Linux, you can probably connect it to the Internet, and run a webserver 
            from it to tell people what you're playing!!!!!!

          then you might be interested in this Chemical Brothers remix of some 
          Mecury Rev thingy... Because they've releasedas an MP3!!!!!!!! This 
          is courtesy of of the Ultimate Band Website, apparently !!!!!! Unfortunately

          <P> Sorry, UBL, if you really want people to put in their email addrs 
            in to get the MP3, then don't put the downloads on a publicly accessible 
            page like that!!!!!! Of course, if they've got wind of this small 
            point, you may find that that URL doesn't work for you!!!! In which 
            case, you'll have to go here, and think of an "imaginative" email

          (I still thought the Atari Lynx was much better tho!!!) because they 
          wanted to wait until technology actually advanced to the point when 
          the sort of thing they wanted it to do wasn't to expensive to produce!!!! 
          So now they're doing it- but if they waited a few months, they could

          Ultra-Stealth-Ninja PC "box" which will test the 3D hardware a bit more 
          than a console text display!!!!! Unfortunately one of the early ones 
          didn't last very long- which might have something to do with the fact 
          that the object of the game was to kill priests!!!!! Now there's a linux 
          game called Sin!!!! So we'll probably get some "expose" by the Daily 
          Mail two years from now about an "evil computer cult" called "Linox"

          that a lot of people on the InfoPipeWebHighway do a lot when they're 
          surfing!!!! Everytime they point and click at a link, it's because they're 
          wanting to do "it"!!!! In fact, they can't really surf without doing 
          "it"!!!!! I am of course talking about using the mouse, you dirty people!!!! 
          But you can do something else with your hands, believe it or not!!!!! 
          You can "twiddle" with your "Twiddler"!!!!! That's because the "Twiddler" 
          is an intresting combination of the a mouse and that neat 5-key keyboard 
          replacement thingy that came out in the 80s!!!!! I notice you have to 
          "grip" it in a certain way....

          right- someone's done a MIDI rackmounted box that faithfully emulates

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jupiter isn't 
          the only big planet around this week!!!!!! A planet twice the size has 
          been found orbiting a star in the constellation of Cancer!!!! Seeing 
          as the planet hasn't got a name yet, and the world's astronomical community 
          failed to take my advice last time, (See <a href="1.html#16"> issue 
          1</A>...) I will give them another chance... [clears throat!!!!] Ahem!!!!!! 
          I think the planet should be called "<B>Big Blob</B>"- because it's 
          big and blobby!!!!!!!!!

Well, if we presume that each line of your somewhat-absurdly oversized
(but intriguing nonetheless) .sig file represents 20 CDs, my collection is
as large as the graphic is tall.. (what a pain in the ass way to answer,
eh?)
