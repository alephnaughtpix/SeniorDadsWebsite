<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There are a lot of people at the moment knocking Glen Hoddle because of
his remarks about disabled people!!!!!!!!! Well, OK, the comments were a bit
"off" to say the least, but I really think people should leave him alone!!!!
After all, an ability to put one's foot in one's mouth so spectacularly is
obviously a punishment for sins in a previous life, isn't it?!?!?!??!! (Ho
ho!!!!!)
<P>
I noticed something else this week!!!!!! And it begs a question: who decided
that Hot Chocolate were hip again?!??!?! Not that I'm complaining of course,
but I'm starting to see Hot Chocolate "Greatest Hits" compils appearing out
of nowhere, and now their singer Errol Brown's popped up, singing their late
70s ballad "I'll Put You Back Togther Again" on an ad for hot chocolate
(Boom boom!!!) drinks!!!!
</FONT><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">
And this is not the first time the band have become hip again!!!! They did
it before (twice!!!!!!) in the 80s!!!!!!! There must be some comittee
somewhere that decides these things!!!!!!! And I'd like to get in contact
with them, in order to get advance warning so that next time I can dig out
all my old Hot Choclate records from the attic, and make everyone think I'm
really hip!!!!!!!!!!

          and you can imagine what the first Sony Walkman was like!!!!!!!!! But 
          we might get one now!!!!!!!! That's because, thanks to some spiffy new 
          open source software, you can now use it as a mobile hard drive!!!!!!!!!!!! 
          Yes, that's right, thanks to this stuff, you can download and upload 
          files from your Rio, and not just MP3/Wavs either!!!!! There are two 
          versions of this software, one is more "Windowsy" and the other is more

          <P> <a href="http://www.mp3place.com/">http://www.mp3place.com/</a> 
          <P> At least they haven't gone completely mad about this new development!!!! 
            Unlike <B>Wired News</B>, who seem to getting more hysterical of late!!!!!!!!!! 
            Which we're sure is nothing to do with the fact that they're now that 
            they're basically just a big news service after all the "trendy" bits 
            of Wired Digital were chopped by their new owners!!!!!!!!! (See <a href="8.html#251"> 
            issue 8</A>...) We've already reported on them trying to get "hip" 
            again with that "drugs" story, (See <a href="22.html#647"> issue 22</A>...) 
            now they're reporting this story, giving it an "Oh woe is MP3 now!!!!!!! 
            And all because these wily hackers have torpodoed the Rio by making 
            it doing something that the Recording Industry of America won't like!!!!!!!!"

          If you as old as me, you might dimly remember a spiffy little musical 
          group called <B>The KLF</B>!!!!!!! You might even remember that they 
          were also called <B>The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu</B> or <B>The JAMMs</B>, 
          and they did this interesting album called "<B>1987: What the F@&%s 
          Going On?"</B>, which had loadsa samples on it!!!!! Unfortuntely one 
          of the people sampled was Abba, and their manager decided to sue their 
          rear entrances off the JAMMs unless they destroyed the album and it's 
          master tapes!!!!!!!!!!!! So they did!!!!!! And it's now an extremely 
          difficult album to get hold of!!!!!!!!!!! 
          <P> Fast forward 12 years later, and we were checking out the latest 
            new music in the vaults of <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">http://www.mp3.com/</a> 
            , and we found a section for a group called "<B>The Jams</B>", and 
            yep, apparently it's the same lot!!!!!!! And there's two new tunes 
            from them on their section!!!!!! The first of them is called <B>"3AM 
            Impure Trance</B>, which is billed as <I>"The White House Music Anthem, 
            featuring the vocal talents of Mrs.Hillary Rodham Clinton."</I>!!!!!! 
            The second is called <B>"Viva Viagra"</B>, and I bet you can't guess 
            what that's all about!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
          <P> <a href="http://www.mp3.com/jams">http://www.mp3.com/jams</a> 
          <P> But that's not all!!!!!!! These two tracks are apparently tasters 
            for a new JAMMs album called *"<B>2987</B>"*, which is being released 
            on 23rd February!!!!!! Why the music papers haven't reported on this 
            momentous occasion, we do not know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But you can read 
            about it on their slightly cheapo looking website here... Well, they've 
            burned a million pounds, what do you expect their website to look 
            like?!?!?! Really professional?!?!?!?!

          person certainly knows how to get people annoyed!!!!! One of his recent 
          columns on Slashdot tangled with the throny issue of articifical intelligence, 
          and whether it's possible soon or not... Katz argued it was!!!!!!!! 
          Just add more fuel to the fire, he argued it in the middle of a book 
          review by some bloke, who had also argued in favour of artificial intelligence 
          soon-ish, but had done so in such a way as to hype up his own consulting 
          agency!!!!!!!! 
          <P> The comments following it were even more enjoyable!!!!!!!! They 
            started off with the usual "Woah!!! Kewl!!! Hook me up, man!!!" type 
            comments, then the "Oh, it'll never happen!!!!!!!!" type guff took 
            over!!!!!!!! At which point things degenerated to the point where 
            people were arguing about the Turing Test, (Where you have a conversation 
            with someone over a text console linkup, and you've to determine on 
            that basis alone whether or not you've been talking with a computer 
            or a real person!!!!!) with the usual "But, even if they do pass the 
            Turing Test, computers don't have any soul, man!!!" type arguments 
            (Which is completely irrelevant to the Turing Test anyway!!!!!!), 
            and there was even a spot of Evolution vs Creationism arguments!!!!!! 
            All in all, the most hilarious load of comments we've ever seen, since 
            we looked at ITV Teletext Viewer Letters on p327 yesterday, anyway!!!!!!!!

          <P> But Katz and co. may soon have the last laugh!!!!! Apparently some 
            clever scientest people have perfected a "dynamics-based computation" 
            technique that uses chaotic elements to "evolve" answers!!!!! This 
            is apprently a new alternative to the usual digital computing methods, 
            and apparently <I>"may be well suited for optical computing using 
            ultra-fast chaotic lasers and computing with silicon/neural tissue 
            hybrid circuitry"</I>!!!!!!!! 
          <P> Argh!!! "Silicon/neural tissue hybrid"?!?!?! Isn't that what the 
            Borg are made of, or something?!?!?!?!? I wouldn't like to be assimilated 
            by a dynamics-based computer whilst trying to get it to "evolve" an 
            answer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
