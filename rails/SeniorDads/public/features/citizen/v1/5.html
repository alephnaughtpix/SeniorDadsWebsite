<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, readers on email might notice the difference!!!
It's now readable!!!! Yep, sorry for all that "two massive columns running into
each other" type formatting on the last edition- I just took the HTML version I
stick on the webpage and saved it as text file!!!! In fact, I had to alter the
flippin' HTML page as for some reason it could save as text because of all
the funny complex tables and formatting. In fact, the HTML versh might need
a bit of 'WebLint', as there appears to be one or two odd errors that crop
up, most notably the amazing propensity for the lovely GM theme by Mozart
to crash Netscape if being reloaded from the cache!!! <P>
Anyway, I've made a nice clean template especially for email readers, so
whenever I set the "issue compilation" rolling, it makes up a nice text
version which manages not to wraparound like a mad wraparound thingy!!!!
Next I'll probably try fixing the HTML stuffs...<P>
BTW I haven't heard any noises yet about the possible name change to "Senior
Netzien"!!! Is anyone particularly opposed to it?!?!

The Hughi small proggy compy (Aren't the first 2 words

we had in the Atari scene at the beginning of this year,

Well, the PC dudes haven't got down to 128 bytes yet!!!! So, all

things which give off low electromagnetic fields (eg the microwaves

the best sign is the announcement from Twentieth Century Fox Home

Jingle All The Way, Marked For Death, Home Alone 3, and Hope Floats!!!
The only decent titles in the whole bunch are The Abyss and Young
Frankenstien!!! I suppose we'll just have to brave cheapo

contributing to a move in the Gulf Stream, which usually brings all
the mild weather to Britain, and thus global warning might make for
colder weather in the UK!!! Or so said some TV prog I saw recently...

look the bottom of the ad... It's not the final version!!!! Yes!!!
They're toys from the original designs, and not the final designs
used in the actual film!!!!

for the millenium bug, was run on Windows 98, it said that 98 might
suffer from a millenium prob!!!! Then the makers of Prove It 2000
checked more carefully, and found it didn't suffer from the
end-of-millenium bug!!!! It suffered from an end-of-every-year bug!!! Apparently
Windows 98 leaps two days forward or one day back when the clock
ticks past midnight on Hogmany (or New Year's Eve for non-Scottish
readers!!!), for every year they tested!!!!!

already used it?!!? You might find yourself getting sued by
someone on the other side of the world because you're using one
of their trademarks!!! So some company has decided to make money
off you by making sure that this doesn't happen!!!! You can search for
the domain name you want and see if you clashes with any trademarks!!!
So far, no-one's taken seniordads.* !!! (Don't get any ideas tho!!!!!)

Now they've bought Microprose, a software company that made a game called
Falcon!!! Seeing as they appear to really like Falcons, I wonder if they'll
try to buy Scotland next?!?! There's a lot of Falcons there you know!!!!!!!!!

shoot in night-vision!!! Unfortunely when this "feature" is used in daylight,
the "night-vision" works out a bit more like Superman's X-ray vision- on people
that is!! So an average shot of a nice family day in the park shot through this
camera will end up looking like a rather blurry old pic of a nudist colony!!!!
<P>
For some extraordinary reason, Sony have recalled this wonder of modern
technology!!! Shame on them I say- not that I'm a peeping tom or anything...

they do those funny yoghurt and rice thingies with little bits of jam in them?!?!)
have come up with this thingy called the M400, which is apparently better than cars
and stuff!! "No matter how you look at it the automobile is only an interim step on our
evolutionary path to independence from gravity." they say!!! I think the driving test
for this vehicle would be a bit harder tho!!!!!!!!
