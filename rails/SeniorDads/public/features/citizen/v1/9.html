<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some of the people on the mailing list might know about this
already, but for the benefit of everyone else, it's been a bit of an
exciting week for the Senior Dads website- or rather the server the website
is sitting on!!! By the time you're reading this, the Grelb server, which has
housed the Senior Dads webpages since 1995 may be out of service, and our
pages may be on a completely different server!!! Of course, if you're
reading this on the website, you'll know if the pages are still on Grelb
or not, but they're going to be off the Grelb server by the end of the month
anyway!!!
<P>
This sudden move is not being made by us, but by the people who run Grelb,
and the reason is academic politics!!!! As some of you might have noticed,
the Grelb server was situated in the Glasgow Uni domain- this was because
it was started up as a little project by Glasgow Uni students, including one
of our friends, who maintains the SD site!!! Since then, nearly all the
students have left Uni... Now there's pretty strict guidelines on use of
facilities on the JANET network, so obviously sooner or later questions
would be asked about the Grelb site, which was mostly used by non-students
and had a lot of "third-party" pages (eg our site!!!)!!!! So just in time
for the new term, the dudes at Grelb have decided to shut down Grelb, and
relocate it to another machine outside JANET!!! This is supposed to happen
on the very day this issue is released, but if it doesn't, it'll happen
eventually anyway by the end of the month!!!!
<P>
Grelb users have been warned that the new machine will have a lower bandwith
connection, and that it's only really medium-term, so we might have to look
for a new site ourselves anyway!!! (Anyone know of any site which allows CGI
progs and server-side includes?!?!?!?)

heavily on the consciences on some of the priveledged senior citizens!!!! One
Lord speaking on a compeletely different subject started off his speech by
complaining that someone had broken into the House of Lords website and put
some "disgusting" porno piccies on it!!!! Only one problem tho- no-one else
noticed any "naughty" stuff on the website before or after he said
anything!!!!
<P>
Hmmm, well, obviously he wouldn't be mixing his bookmarks up or anything
like that, so maybe there's a porno "soundalike" equivalent for the House
of Lords, a bit like <a href="http://www/whitehouse.com/">http://www/whitehouse.com/</a> !!!!!

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, the problems 
          between sample combo Negativland and the record industry (See <a href="8.html#246"> 
          issue 8</A>...) seems to be fixed now, and it's actually a bit of a 
          revolutionary settlement!!! As reported last week, Negativland found 
          that their new album wasn't getting pressed by CD plants, apparently 
          on the orders of the Recording Industry Association of America, because 
          of all their sampling!!! Now the industry have reached a sort of agreement 
          about the "grey areas" of using samples of other peoples songs in original 
          compositions... Although this idea has been kind of understood for years, 
          this is actually the first time it has been recognised officially by 
          a record industry body!!! So this is actually a rather important decision, 
          which will fundamentally affect the various copyright issues around 
          sampling!!!! Well done, Negativland!!!!

the days before you had to shoot at loads of people in
3d-texture-shaded-funged-virtual-reality engine thingies with big names like
"Messiah" and "Bigger than Jesus" and so on, adventures were like really
complex books with no pictures, expect that it was often very hard to turn
the page!!!! Most of the actual coding in these adventures went into
super-duper command line programs that tried to understand what the user was
typing, and how to carefully steer the user into typing only a couple of
possible things so that they didn't have to code an artificial intelligence
algorithm, which might not fit too well in a proggy for a 16K Speccy!!!!!!
<P>Anyway, someone's done the very first adventure ever (Done in the days
when they always played Kraftwerk every time there was something computery
on the telly!!!) on tha megamighty webby inpho-pipe!!! Yay!!

There's always been a little problem with making computers smaller and
smaller- at some point, it's going to be small enough that atoms at the
quantum level are going to add loadsa errors!!! Well, now some clever people
have invented ... quantum error correction!!!! So now we'll be able to build
computers even smaller!!!

For example, remember those little boxes of plastic stringy stuff that you
used on Sinclair computers (eg the Speccy and QL) because it was faster than
tape but not quite as expensive as a hard disk?!?!?! (Ahh, memories!!!
"Wouldn't it be lovely if I could afford a 'Winchester' drive with THREE
WHOLE MEGABYTES in it!??!?!?!")
<P>
Well, Microdrives are back, but not courtesy of Sinclair Research, but old
"Big Blue", who are of course IBM, not a porno website as you may be
thinking!!!!! And unlike the Speccy Microdrive Class of 1981, it's not under
a megabyte of magnetic coated plastic stringy stuff, it's actually a little
hard drive with a capactity of 340MB!!!! It's also a little bit smaller-
about 1 inch square!!!! So a "Comm badge" with built-in "Universal
Translator" doesn't look too far away, does it?!?!?!

          bollox that I last saw when I first came on the Internet in the early 
          90s, and it was dominated by "Age of Aquarius" type tracts from ageing 
          hippy types based on The Well!!! 
          <P> Probably the best article of the week was from Salon, who at least 
            still have the "media" articles that Hotwired used to have!!! (See 
            <a href="8.html#251"> issue 8</A>...) Their story pokes quite a few

          didn't tell that "Linux Babylon" story (See <a href="8.html#238"> issue 
          8</A>...) this week, as it wouldn't have been so funny!!!!!!! That's 
          because it turns out that the makers of the game dev system for Linux 
          have discovered that someone already has used the name "Babylon"!!! 
          They're now changing their name to "Babel", and they've also changed 
          their homepage!!!! However, I wouldn't be too surprised if someone's 
          already used "Babel"... I mean, we're talking about something that suggests 
          either "Tower of Babel" (Which was a rather good little game in the 
          early 90s for the Atari ST!!!) or the "Babel-fish" in the "Hitchhikers 
          Guide To The Galaxy"!!! (Which also was used recently by AltaVista- 
          see <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/">http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/</a>

Some people have been complaining about the state
of <a href="news://alt.digitiser">news://alt.digitiser</a> !!! Apparently the newsgroup devoted to the UK
Teletext "mag" <B>Digitiser</B> has got a large "noise-to-signal"
ratio, contains a lot of chit-chat which is not really relevant to Digitiser,
and has the odd people flaming back and forth!!!!
<P>
Well, for most older Usenet hacks like me, it was a cause for celebration, as
those were all the old cliches of an alt.* newsgroup, and it would mean that
after many months it was finally an established newsgroup!!!! But some of
the "newbies" have been thinking that the newsgroup is "dead" or something
ridiculous like that!!!! Of course, it's in a bit of a quiet period because
it's between Uni terms, and so a lot of the regular Digi fans don't have
access to email, ut matters seems to have come to a head at the end of
last week when some person called "zygotes" sent an email to an awful lot of
people saying he "deleted" the newsgroup!!!!!! Well, I didn't notice any
difference at Deja News!!!!!! It later turned out to be a bit of a mess-up,
and "zygotes" apologised, but the kerfuffle, a few people announced the
group was dead and that they were leaving, and then "contraversial" journalist
Stuart Campbell wrote a "outspoken" message saying he was leaving as well,
blaming messages by a couple of people who had left the newsgroup long
ago!!!!!
<P>
To be honest I can't what all the fuss is about!!!! You "headless chicken"
types really ought to relax, and take up Transcendental Meditation, like
that young chap Willie Hague!!!!

Now my tupenny worth... It seems to me that the group didn't die because of
any crap messages or general irrelevance, because you get that in nearly
any flippin' newsgroup!!!! It looks to me like the newsgroup's just died
merely because enough people have believed it to be dead!!!! I haven't seen
any appreciable drop in quality or otherwise in the messages, but suddenly
everyone's talking like alt.digi's dead and the suddenly the number of
messages drop like a stone!!!!! If I were the "coroner", I'd say alt.digi
has just died of "mass hysteria"!!!!! Mind you, with the college terms
now starting. I wouldn't surprised if we get a couple of old faces back
going "Duh, what happened?!?!?!"
