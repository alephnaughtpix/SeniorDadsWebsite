Erm, anyway- the setting up of the "proper" mailing list is being slightly
delayed because we're finishing off our classic ASCII remix of "Space
Invaders"!!!! It'll work on Atari computers, and probably the Pacifist
emulator on da PC!!!! Anyway, I'm doing a couple of tests of a mailing
device from the existing SDWWWHQ, so it won't be too long!!!!
      <P> Incidentelly, this Grelb move I was talking about a couple of weeks 
        ago (See <a href="9.html#"> issue 9</A>...) seems to be taking a lot longer 
        than expected... It's already October, and Fresher's Week has just ended 
        at Glasgow Uni, and it's still not moved!!!! But it'll probably move soon, 
        so keep using the <B>seniordads.home.ml.org</B> address!!!

not!!!!! Because here's a *<B>real</B>* computer romance book writer!!!!
<B>Personal Passions</B>, some wacky US Internet service thingy, have gone
one step better than wedding videos, and have invented *<B>personalised
romance novels</B>*!!! Apparently if you give them some money, they feed
the details of you and your partner into some computer thingy, which then
goes away and writes a romance novel!!!!! So now you can give your friends
something that'll really make them vomit!!!!! (If they ever read it!!!!!)

film was made today, he would be delayed because he needed to reboot
Windows!!!!! This is because there are now apparently a new generation of
robots controlled by PCs!!!!!!!! They can do things like <I>"serve you
drinks, set a VCR, even vacuum your apartment. "</i> I don't know if I like
the last idea tho!!! I mean, if a robot was to race all round the house
with my Dyson, whilst still connected to the PC, it would cause a lot of
damage!!!!!!!!!!

bored looking at this road, I wish I could watch Countdown instead!!!!
But I can't watch TV in the car beacuse the metal frame in conjunction
with interference generated by the engine jams any TV signals coming
in!!!!!" Well, don't worry, now thanks to the miracle of digital TV
some bods have worked out how to correct for the interference, and
now you can watchs TV in a car!!!! It'll certainly be an interesting
experience to watch "<B>Police! Stop!</B>" on TV whilst you're driving
down the motorway at 100 miles an hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!

nouvelle cuisine as you might think!!!! It's actually a way to solve the
problem of the length of storage in DVD disks!!! At the moment the DVD
disks haven't been long enough on either side for a full movie, and so
halfway through, you would have to flip over to the other side of the disk,
just like on a gramaphone!!!!! But now they've worked out how to "sandwich"
two sides onto the same side, and they apparently have increased the length
on the single side to 6 hours!!!! (Yes, I know that makes it sound as though
one normal DVD side has 3 hours and so is long enough for most movies-
don't ask me how they work these things out!!!!!!!!!)

such classic headlines as <I>"Duuble-decker bus found in South Pole!!!!!"</I>
and <I>"WW2 bomber found on Moon- vanishes!!!!!"</I> Well, we were extremely
pleased to see this headline:<P>
<UL><B>"Adult Star to Dance Nude on World Wide Web Throughout
Pregnancy"</B></UL><P>
What's odd is that it didn't come from the Sunday Sport, but <B>Yahoo Business
News</B>!!!!! Obviously those stocks 'n' shares spots aren't getting enough of
an audience!!!!!! Anyway, apparently the "adult star" (Well, I would be
extremely worried if it was a little kid!!!!!!!) is on <B>Tabitha Stevens</B>,
who has presumably changed quite a lot from when she appeared as a kid on that
lovely family show <B>Bewitched</B>!!!!!!!!!

          from last month's gamma ray exposure!?!?!?! (ooh-er!!!) Well, you should 
          be affected, as a star from a quite a few light years away threw out 
          a gigantic gamma ray pulse, which affected 7 satellites in orbit around 
          the Earth, shutting down 2 of them for a short time!!! It even <I>"it 
          knocked electrons out of the atoms in Earth's upper atmosphere"</I> 
          !!!!!! Apparently the culprit is this star is called <B>Aquila</B>, 
          which is something called a "magnetar", which ... er, doesn't this sound 
          familiar!??!?! Oh yeah, we've mentioned magnetars before!!! (See <a href="5.html#166"> 
          issue 5</A>...) And in the story referenced, Aquila got a mention!!!!!

sold in the US with the words "What would Jesus do" on them!!!! Unfortunately
they're made of lead, and not properly sealed up and can cause to lead
poisoning!!!!! So for loads of people their fervent belief in the Son of God
has cost them quite a few cells in the brain department!!!!!!!

The Americans have just found out about this brilliant
little wheeze to use power lines for net access!!!! Why, we've only been

it'll take them to find out about the brilliant side-effect of this idea-
it turns the streetlights into radio transmitters!!!!

some "famous" person wearing "shades" whilst walking past the "papparazzi",
who then trips up and falls into a plant pot, what are you likely to say!??!
Well, you'll probably say: "Oh, he's checking up on his share options"!!!!!!
The reason you'll be saying this is because "shades" in the future will
not really be shades!!!! Sony had just developed LCD Screens which can be
put in "shades"!! So you'll be able to check up on the latest news, whilst
you're tripping over everyone!!!!

<B>Evl</B> of <B>Dead Hackers Society</B> about a mysterious crew called
"<B>The Poets of Bombay</B>" Well, we just heard about this mysterious crew
through a release we saw at the <B>Reservoir Gods Cwmvention</B> the
previous week!!! It turns out that someone calling themselves "<B>Muhatma
Ghandhi</B>" had mailed 20 copies of a 560K demo to Evl, and as a result
of his full mailbox the whole system had come to a standstill!!!!! As a
result, the demo is getting a plug on the DHS site, but he forwarded one
of the mails to us. After working out how the hell to run the demo (It
turns out that the demo is for an Atari Faclon using a VGA display!!!),
we watched it, and were a little surprised to find a completely different
demo to the one we saw at the Cwmvention- these dudes must be a little
busy!!!<P></font>
