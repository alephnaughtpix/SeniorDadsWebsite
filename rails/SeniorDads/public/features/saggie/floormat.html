<P><B>[ ST FORMAT-IC FOR THE PEOPLE ]</B> <I>[Wow,
where do they get those wacky titles?]</FONT></I></P>

<P>The Senior Dads have released a new demo called &quot;ST Floormat&quot;.
As the title suggests it is heavily based around Future Publishing's deceased
magazine, and as usual it is a colostomy bag full of laughs. Full review
in the next issue. </P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>However, they managed to review it in the <B>same</B>
issue! Nice review but it would have helped if you read the text file as
you're talking a load of rubbish about the demo! We'll detail all the mistookies
that Maggie made at the end ...</FONT></I> </P>

<H3>ST Floormat Demo - Senior Dads.. (ST and Falcon)</FONT></H3>

<IMG src="../../images/features/saggie/flr1.gif" alt="" align=right><P>And finally, you can't keep the Senior Dads down for long (nor would
you care to try!) The ST Floormat demo is their 'tribute' to the sadly
deceased ST Format magazine, a publication famed for being informative
and 'On topic', especially with legendary editors Paula Richards and Trenton
Webb at the helm.. Anyway, this demo was allegedly inspired by an article
produced during the tenure of Trenton Webb, titled &quot;Demo Coders. are
they crap or wot?&quot; The Dads decided to draw upon their deep and intimate
knowledge of coding, as given to them by the ST Format coding gurus, and
this demo is the end result.. </P>

<P>Well, not quite the end, as they held onto it for quite some time, to
make sure that STF was really dead, before they could risk releasing it,
and avoiding packs of litigation crazed zombie lawers making low moaning
noises and gently tap-tapping on the windows of the Senior Dads World GHQ..
</P>

<IMG src="../../images/features/saggie/flr2.gif" alt="" align=right><P>As we said earlier, all their coding knowledge, given to them by the
wise wordsmiths of STF is shown in here.. The stunning rasters, the ultra-smooth
top border scroll, and even ST Format's patented top and bottom border
removal technique, which involves nothing more than switching the monitor
from 50 to 60 hertz! Now why didn't Tex, Level 16 and company, think of
that!? Oh yes, the soundchip music takes you right back to those classic
days as well.. </P>

<P>If you can avoid a migraine, the scrolltext is well worth a look too..
</P>

<P>Rating - 95% - Well, what are you waiting for!! </P>

<H3><I>Senior Dads say..</FONT></I></H3>

<UL>
<LI><I>What the hell's &quot;<B>ST Format</B>&quot;?
We were talking about a magazine called &quot;ST <B>FLOORMAT</B>&quot;,
as in the magazine that used to be &quot;ST/Amiga Floormat&quot;!!! </FONT></I></LI>

<LI><I>We didn't learn our coding knowledge from
Floormat! If fact it was them that ripped it off us! The music, GFX and
scroller text is by them, but the rest was our original demo! </FONT></I></LI>

<LI><I>And who on Earth is Trenton Webb? Sounds like
a made-uppie if you ask us!!! </FONT></I></LI>
