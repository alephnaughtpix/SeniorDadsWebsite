      Howdee-doody my friends- if you've ever wondered who is responsible for all the visual splendour of this web site and the Senior Dads <a href="../images/demos/default.html">demos</a>, then look no further. Welcome to my own private gallery! <strong><em>(Cue spooky &quot;Gallery&quot; music from &quot;Vision on&quot;.)</em></strong> Feel free to look around, but please remember to take all you litter home with you!

      I joined the crew as they were planning to launch their website. They were sorely needing a new artistic direction for their beacon in Cyberspace, so, having heard I was an &quot;arty&quot; type of person, Doddering Git asked me to join the crew over a pint of snakebite at the Rolf Harris bar at the student union. I gave the website a new graphical design angle, based around a specially designed <strong><a rel="lightbox-JP" title="My iconic Senior Dads logo!" href="../images/sad_logo.gif">Senior Dads logo</a></strong>. The guys were so impressed, they asked me to join their crew as an official member! ... And the rest is history... <strong><em>(Cue epic historical type music.)</em></strong>

      Do you like this background BTW? I'm now learning how to use <strong>Photoshop</strong>, so expect to see further examples of this cropping up in future demos!!
