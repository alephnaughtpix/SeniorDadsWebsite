          At the start of every Dads demo- this was the version at the start of <a href="../demos/atuck.html">Anal Tuck</a>. It signifies the end of the crumbling empire attitudes of those opposed to <em>&quot;one nation under a techno groove&quot;,</em> know what I'm saying?

Made to piss off that thick Neanderthal troglodyte Manc bastardo Gallagher twat, who said that people would dance to farts if they stuck beats on top of them. Well, of course they would, most beats-fortified farts hit the spot better than your shit-for-brains Beatle rip-offs, you top prize wankaah! So I made this killer chune completely outta burps! Beat that, <strong>Oasisn't</strong>!!!

          Lost after 14 years, so rare even I forgot about it! This chune was added in our patch to Reject's demo. We did this tune in response to some guys in Poland called the RASERO TEAM, who thought they were being clever by doing a demo called 'Senior Fucks out'! You wot, mate?!? That demo was just shit, and the "music" didn't even get the bass frequencies right! Maybe you can't code to our level, guys, but at least you can get the chunes sorted! So that's what I did, just to show them who's boss. A cool jungle remix of a shite lamers tune, know what I'm sayin'?
    %h3<> Is that all, Mr Music Man?
    %p<> Quality, not quantity, that's my motto!
